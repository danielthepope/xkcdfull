  "transcript": "[A picture of Megan wearing aviator goggles, sitting in an autogyro and holding the control stick. The autogyro is surrounded by sentence fragments, explaining characteristics of it. The one above the blade that concerns the blade has an arrow pointing from the text to the blade. The sentences in columns from the left (i.e. first four sentences to the left, then two above the autogyro's body, and finally six sentences to the right):]\nLooks like a helicopter, but is nothing like a helicopter\nFlies like a plane but is nothing like a plane\nSort of like a powered parachute\nRare in the US, usually homemade. Common in Europe.\nBig blade on top is not powered and spins freely\nCan often be flown without a license\nCheap\nNeeds a runway to take off, but not a long one\nCan land vertically\nCannot hover\nNever stalls\nExtremely safe, unless you do the one thing you instinctively do to escape a stall in a normal airplane, in which case it will crash immediately.[Caption below the panel:]\nAutogyros are weird."
