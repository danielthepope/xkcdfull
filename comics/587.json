  "transcript": "[A crime scene is surrounded by tape wound around several pins four of which are inside this panel. A large black pool is on the ground, with splashes around it, and a hammer lying in one of these splashes. Two people are standing outside the tape; a police officer with a peaked cap with a white emblem is standing closest and to his left is a man with male pattern baldness, who we learn is called George.]\nPoliceman: Looks like a murder-suicide.\nGeorge: Any interesting mathematical patterns?\nPoliceman: No, George, just two dead bodies and a lot of blood.\nGeorge: Two... That's the third Fibonacci number!\nPoliceman: Not now, George.[Caption below the frame:]\nWhen Mathnet shut down, the officers had trouble reintegrating into the regular L.A.P.D."
