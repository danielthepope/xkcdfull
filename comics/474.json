  "transcript": "[Cueball walks up to Megan sitting at bar.]\nCueball: So, the LHC's turning on. This could be our last night on earth.\n[While Beret Guy as a bartender walks into the frame Megan replies without turning]\nMegan: Gimme a break. They're not even colliding yet, and it won't do anything cosmic rays haven't.\n[Cueball turns and walks away. But then Megan turns towards him and says:]\nMegan: Hey, I didn't say no.\nMegan: I'm a physics grad student. I need the excuse to party.\n[Cueball turns back and they talk:]\nCueball: So, you're up for a night with a charming stranger?\nMegan: Depends. Top or bottom?\nCueball: Hey, I haven't even bought you a drink.\nMegan: Barkeep, two whiskey sours, straight down."
