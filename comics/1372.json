  "transcript": "A USE FOR SMARTWATCHES:\n[Depicted are two smartwatches, both labelled as \"Working\" and showing generic colour displays, and one smartphone labelled as \"Dead\" with a blank screen.][A hacksaw cutting through the smartphone, throughout the middle of the long edge of the case.][The two smartwatches are shown with the wristband and case broken around the edge of the display because the displays with the associated electronics are removed. Arrows are shown coming from the smartwatch cases to the smartwatch displays, then from the displays to the smartphone case halves.][The smartphone halves are installed with the smartwatch components and a hinge with screws beside is shown. Another view shows the hinge screwed into the back of the smartphone case.][The smartphone with the working smartwatch components installed is shown, with the hinge three-quarters open and fully closed - resembling an early flip-phone.]\nWorld's first flip iPhone"
