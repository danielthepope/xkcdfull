Ponytail reach out with her microphone towards Cueball:]\nPonytail: Is it true you've been unable to find evidence that the G-spot exists?[Zoom in on Cueball and the top of the lectern:]\nCueball: My research is in solar cells. I think you have the wrong press conference.[Beat panel with the same view as before.][Same view but now Cueball hangs his head.]\nCueball: But... yes."
