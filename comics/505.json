  "transcript": "[Cueball is standing in a desert with lots of rocks lying around. He is narrating his own situation. The first panel spans the entire width of the comic. The first line of text is written to the left of him, the second line to the right.]\nSo I'm stuck in this desert for eternity.\nI don't know why. I just woke up here one day.[The next four panels take up the second line of the comic.]\n[Cueball stand in the desert.]\nI never feel hungry or thirsty.[Cueball walks in the desert.]\nI just walk.[Zooming out while Cueball continues to walk in the desert.]\nSand and rocks[Zooming far out as Cueball again just stands in the desert. First line of text, above him, is a continuation of the text in the previous panel. The second line is below him.]\nstretch to infinity.\nAs best as I can tell.[The next three panels take up the third line of the comic. The last takes up half the width.]\n[Cueball is sitting in the desert, in a contemplative position. First line of text above him the second below.]\nThere's plenty of time for thinking out here.\nAn eternity really.[Cueball is sketching stuff in the sand. First line of text above him the second below.]\nI've rederived modern math in the sand\nand then some.[Three different graph types are depicted. First line of text above them the second below.]\nPhysics too. I worked out the kinks in quantum mechanics and relativity.\nTook a lot of thinking, but this place has fewer distractions than a Swiss patent office.[The next eight panels take up the fourth and fifth line of the comic. All pictures are the same size.]\n[Cueball is walking along the desert, laying out rocks on a line. Four has been deployed, he is laying down the fifth and has a sixth in his other hand.]\nOne day I started laying down rows of rocks.[Cueball with a rock in his hand, continues to deploy rocks 16, in a more intricate pattern. There are grid-lines in the sand (5 rows, 6 columns), with each intersection either empty of filled with a rock. No rocks lay anywhere but at an intersection on the grid.]\nEach new row followed from the last in a simple pattern.[Zooming out showing even more laid out rocks. Cueball is seen directly from above, and we see his shadow falling on the grid of rocks (7 rows, 14 columns).]\nWith the right set of rules and enough space,[Continues to zoom further out showing clear triangular patterns (with no rocks) in the laid out grid of rocks. Cueball is not seen. (8 rows, 42 columns). First line of text above the grid, the second line below.]\nI was able to build a computer.\nEach new row of stones is the next iteration of the computation.[Zooming far out (no Cueball) with rows intersected by five clear V lines on top of them. The V's are drawn inside each other, with the smallest V at the top right, and the other V's starting just to the right of the previous one, and then continuing the same distance past the previous V, as the total length of the first V. The \"*\" in the first line of text above this grid, references to the footnote below written in a smaller font.]\nSure it's rocks instead of electricity, but it's the same* thing. Just slower.\n*Turing-complete[Cueball stands in contemplative pose (on a clean white background - i.e. no dessert).]\nAfter a while, I programmed it to be a physics simulator.[A black panel with white drawings and text. A small white dot (a particle) is labeled by two arrows coming of two binary strings.]\nEvery piece of information about a particle was encoded as a string of bits written in the stones.\n00101010\n00101010[A Feynman diagram showing two particles interacting. Two arrows going in and out with a snaking line between them.]\nWith enough time and space, I could fully simulate two particles interacting.[The next two panels take up the sixth line of the comic. The second panel takes up three quarter of the width.]\n[Cueball standing before the vastness of the desert, with his programmed lines of rock stretching to infinity.]\nBut I have infinite time and space.[A black panel with white drawings and text. Depiction of two large galaxies, one with four jets coming out of its center, the other a flat disc. Several smaller galaxies and/or stars are shown around them.]\nSo I decided to simulate a universe.[The next four panels take up the seventh line of the comic. They are of similar widths.]\n[Cueball is walking by his grid of rocks, lines indicate he has just thrown another rock down in its place. It falls so hard it thinks into the sand that splashes out around it. The 14 rocks above him lies on the grid, four other below this grid, have not been used yet.]\nThe eons blur past as I walk down a single row.[Zoom far far out to show multiple rows of rocks. It is not very clear that there are several triangular patterns (with no rocks) in different sizes in the laid out grid of rocks. There are about 50 rows and 90 columns. There are six large triangles on top of each other at the left edge. To the right there are three even larger triangles from top to bottom, the one in the middle further to the left than the one above, but further right than the bottom one.]\nThe rows blur past to compute a single step.[Shows the placement of two particles in the simulation.]\nAnd in the simulation...[The two particles have moved just long enough as to not overlap with their the previous position which are shown as an after-image with faint gray lines. The text continues directly the one from the previous panel.]\nanother instant ticks by.[The next two panels take up the eight line of the comic. They each take up half the width.]\n[A Cueball like person (you) observes a mote of dust vanish.]\nSo if you see a mote of dust vanish from your vision in a little flash or something[Cueball is standing between two rocks on the ground, while holding two rocks, one lifted up to his head. The first line of text is above him. It is a direct continuation of the text in the previous panel. The second line stands below to the right of him.]\nI'm sorry. I must have misplaced a rock\nsometime in the last few billions and billions of millennia.[Cueball stands in the \"clean\" part of his infinite desert, in front of the vastness of his infinity of infinite lines or rocks.]\nOh and...[A Cueball like student sitting in a classroom with his head in his hands, Megan sits behind him and a teacher points to the blackboard; A clock shows the time at five minutes to ten.]\nIf you think the minutes in your morning lecture are taking a long time to pass for you..."
