  "transcript": "[Cueball and Dr. Nash (the Cueball-like guy to the right) stand talking to each other. Cueball is looking left and pointing off-panel.]\nCueball: Hey, Dr. Nash, I think those gals over there are eyeing us. This is like your Nash Equilibrium, right? One of them is hot, but we should each flirt with one of her less-desirable friends. Otherwise we risk coming on too strong to the hot one and just driving the group off.[Cueball is now looking at Dr. Nash.]\nDr. Nash: Well, that's not really the sort of situation I wrote about. Once we're with the ugly ones, there's no incentive for one of us not to try to switch to the hot one. It's not a stable equilibrium.[Cueball again looks left while Dr. Nash shakes his fist.]\nCueball: Crap, forget it. Looks like all three are leaving with one guy.\nDr. Nash: Dammit, Feynman!"
