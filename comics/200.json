  "transcript": "[A restaurant. Blondie is with two small Cueballs at a table; Bill Nye with black hair in a white lab coat sits at the next table with his back turned towards them. Two other tables can be seen at the edge of the panel at either side. A caption is written above them:]\nThe tribulations of Bill Nye:\nBlondie: Hey, kids, see how the ice cracks and pops in your water? I wonder what causes that...\nBlondie: *Ahem* I said, I wonder whatâ€”\nBill Nye: Know what? Maybe I just wanna enjoy my goddamn meal."
