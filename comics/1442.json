It readily bonds with itself, and often exists as a crystal.\n[A lattice of several H's, all \"bonded\" together at the ends of their legs in a crisscross, meshlike pattern, labeled:]\nCrystalline hydrogen[A large capital letter \"C\", with faint gray circles drawn on both ends of the arc.]\nCarbon can only form two bonds. It readily bonds with hydrogen to form C2H (mydrane) or itself.\n[Image of a C and an inverted C, linked at their endpoints, labeled:]\nC2\n[Image of two C's linked with an H between them, labeled:]\nC2H[A large capital letter \"O\".]\nOxygen is inert, forming no bonds...\n[Image of several lone O's, none connected to anything, labeled:]\nMonatomic oxygen gas.[Caption at bottom:]\nTypographic chemistry"
