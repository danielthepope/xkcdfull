  "transcript": "[Side view of Megan standing behind a lectern, speaking to an off-panel audience in front of her. Two people from the audience react to her statement.]\nMegan: We've discovered the most earth-like exoplanet yet!\nOff-panel voices: Yay!![Front view of Megan behind lectern:]\nMegan: Well, it's in the habitable zone. Habitable-ish. \"Habitable.\"\nMegan: The survivable zone.[In a frameless panel with the same setting as before, Megan holds her left hand out with palm up.]\nMegan: It's tidally locked. And blasted with stellar flares. And probably meteors. And bathed in acid.[Closeup side view of Megan, now holding up a finger on her left hand. Again an unseen audience member replies.]\nMegan: But we've detected water vapor! In between all the swinging blades.\nOff-panel voice: I see.\nMegan: We're hoping to find biosignatures in the form of screaming."
