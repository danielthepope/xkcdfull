  "transcript": "[Hairy and Ponytail are standing to the left of a wrapped object. Cueball is standing on the right.]\nHairy: The press is here for the product launch!\nHairy: Remember, people are wary of smart devices, so we want to strike a non-threatening tone.[Pan over to just Cueball; Hairy and Ponytail are off of the left side of the panel.]\nCueball: Hang on, did you say non-threatening?\nHairy: Yes. Why-\nCueball: Nothing. It's probably fine.[Caption: Soon...]\n[Cueball is standing on a platform next to the previously seen wrapped object.]\nCueball: They say technology can change the world, for good or for evil. Our new product will show how true that is.\nCueball: We hear the plaintive cries of our customers. We want to give them what they deserve.[Zoom in on Cueball, who has his hand up in a gesture.]\nCueball: Now, let us expose our product to the atmosphere for the first time, surprising and delighting customers within a five-block radius.\n(Voice off-panel): I'm leaving.\nCueball: No, don't worry! A staggering number of people will survive!"
