No, this is the 80's sci-fi classic!\nFriend: Huh. I didn't know the Olsen twins even did sci-fi.\nCueball: ...They don't.\nFriend: So is Ashley the replicant, or is Mary-Kate? I can never tell them apart.\nCueball: Neither! They're not in this movie!\nFriend: Then who is?\nCueball: Daryl Hannah!\nFriend: I liked her in Full House.\nCueball: I hate you.\nFriend: Man, this movie is just a New York Minute rip-off."
