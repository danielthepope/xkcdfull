  "transcript": "[Beret Guy, extension cord in hand, approaches Cueball as he works at his computer.]\nBeret Guy: Can I plug my extension cord over here?\nCueball: No.\nBeret Guy: Why?\nCueball: Solar Flares.\n[A diagram is displayed, illustrating the Earth's magnetic field being permanently impacted by a large solar flare (represented by a large arrow).]\n[A second diagram is presented, illustrating the Earth's rotation and the resulting impact that the solar flare would have on the earth's magnetic field.]\nCueball: A large solar flare could dent the Earth's magnetic field inwards. The Earth's spin could then induce a strong current in any long conductors, melting them and starting fires. By extending your cord, you could kill us all.\n[Stunned, Beret Guy looks down at the cord he carries.]\nBeret Guy: Really?\nCueball: Warn your friends.\n[Dejected, Beret Guy walks away, cord in tow.]\n[Cueball looks up from his computer as he is braced by Megan, a stern look in her face.]\nMegan: That was mean.\nCueball: Listen, somebody has to keep Mythbusters in business. Next season should be fun."
