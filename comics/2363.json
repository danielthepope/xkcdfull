None of them appear to be selected) (Top Right)\nNIN85 (posted December 5, 2000): So mad that my mom won't let me get a Vespa. I'm old enough for a moped license and they're really not that dangerous.\nJULZ [new user] (posted September 23, 2020): At least she's not stopping you from getting an electric scooter you don't even need a license for\nNIN85 (posted September 23, 2020): Okay, Julian, (A) you know we talked about this, and (B) how the heck did you find this threadSubtitle: I love that message boards are now old enough for this to happen."
