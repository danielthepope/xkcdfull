  "transcript": "[Caption above the frame:]\nNow that Amazon is advertising \none-hour delivery of bottled water,[A larger building complex is show on the left. An arrow goes to a blue bottle in a brown package in the middle of the frame. Another arrow continues over to Cueball on the right. The same building and Cueball is drawn below four more times. More and more bottles in packages are added. First two with a third arrow in between. Then six packages with water, so close that there are only smaller arrows at both ends. Then there is one long package from building to Cueball with 20 bottles close together, with small arrows at both ends of this package. Then finally this turns into a stream of water flowing through a package \"pipe\", shown with one arrow in the middle of the blue water. Again with small arrows at both ends of the pipe.][Caption below the frame:]\nI vote we start calling municipal plumbing \n\"on-demand hyperloop-style water delivery\"\nand see if we can sell anyone on the idea."
