My USB cables fray after like a month.Ponytail: Your heart has been pumping for decades without pausing for even a few minutes.\nPonytail: And your eyes! They're so fragile and exposed![Zoom in on Cueball gazing at his palms.]\nPonytail (off-panel): You're full of all these high-pressure fluids and intricate parts that could kill you in seconds if they stopped working![Zoom out again to the entire scene.]\nCueball: ...can you just tell me whether I'm healthy?\nPonytail: Yeah, you're fine.\nPonytail: Which is weird, given that your body is basically made from dissolved bread."
