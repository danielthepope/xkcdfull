  "transcript": "[Cueball is watching and Ponytail is about to open a time capsule that has just been dug out. A shovel is stuck in the ground next to a heap of dirt on the right side of a hole in the ground. Cueball is standing on the other side and Ponytail is in the hole, proceeding to lift up the lid of the box that makes up the time capsule.]\nPonytail: All right, let's open the time capsule.[Slight zoom in on Ponytail and the box, without Cueball but still the shovel and dirt, when Beret Guy comes out of the capsule looking up at Ponytail who takes a step back up.]\nBeret Guy: Hi!\nPonytail: Where did you come from?!\nBeret Guy: The past! I traveled here in this time machine.[Frame widens to include Cueball, in the same position as in the first frame. Ponytail relaxes a little and Beret Guy turns in the capsule to face Cueball.]\nCueball: How did you... get here from the past?\nBeret Guy: I dunno. I couldn't not.\nCueball: But... what did you eat?\nBeret Guy: Newspapers, mostly.[Zoom in again in a bigger frame with Ponytail and the capsule, shovel and dirt. Beret Guy faces her again, but now he is holding a hammer.]\nBeret Guy: Anyway, I'm here to kill Hitler.\nPonytail: But he died long ago!\nBeret Guy: Oh, good! That was easy.\nBeret Guy: Want to get sandwiches?\nBeret Guy: Do you still have sandwiches?"
