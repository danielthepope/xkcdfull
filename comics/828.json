  "transcript": "[Cueball sits hunched with his knees drawn up to him on a hospital bed, hooked up to an IV. A friend stands by.]\nCueball: I'm sick and I'm scared.\nFriend: Well, remember - having a good attitude is the most important thing. Think positively and you'll get better.[Darkness surrounds Cueball on the bed. The friend is off-screen.]\nCueball: So if I'm sad or afraid or feel like crap sometimes, then...\nFriend: ...then if you don't recover, it will be your fault.[Cueball clutches his hands to his face and leans back.]\nCueball: Well that makes me feel even worse.\nFriend: See? You're doing this to yourself.\nCueball: No!\nFriend: Stop it!\nCueball: Argh![Close up on Cueball, holding up his hand, pointing to himself.]\nCueball: Okay, you know what? Screw this. My attitude isn't my problem. - My disease is my problem, and I'm treating it. - I'm going to be glum and depressed and pessimistic some days, and I'm going to get better anyway.[Cueball sits on the edge of the bed, his friend still standing in front of him.]\nCueball: Wait, that ended up sounding optimistic.\nFriend: I guess you suck at pessimism.\nCueball: Maybe I'll be better at it tomorrow."
