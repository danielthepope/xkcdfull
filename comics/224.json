I saw the naked structure of Lisp code unfold before me.\nCueball: My God\nCueball: It's full of 'car's\nSpeaker: The patterns and metapatterns danced. Syntax faded, and I swam in the purity of quantified conception. Of ideas manifest.[Close-up of floating in space before part of a concept tree.]\nTruly, this was the language from which the gods wrought the Universe.[Floating in space with God appearing through a line of clouds.]\nGod: No, it's not.\nCueball: It's not?\nGod: I mean, ostensibly, yes.
