  "transcript": "[Cueball and Megan standing by a train on a platform.]\nMegan: I'm bad at goodbyes. At some level I never think they're for real.\nCueball: They make me think of T. H. White's Merlin.[They are still standing at the edge of the platform, but the train is no longer in the frame.]\nMegan: Oh?\nCueball: He lived backwards, remembering the future and not the past. To him, final goodbyes meant nothing, while first hellos were tearful and bittersweet.[Zooming out, the rail closest to the platform becomes visible.]\nMegan: Huh - so over the years he'd forget all his friends.\nMegan: Must've been lonely.\nCueball: Yeah. He ended up just sitting around at home watching DVDs all day. The best was the time he rented 'Memento'...[Merlin with pointy hat and long white beard is sitting in a couch with the remote, watching TV which emits light and is clearly hooked up to a device (a DVD player).]\nMerlin: Well, that was straightforward."
