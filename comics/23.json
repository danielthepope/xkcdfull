  "transcript": "[A collection of phrases on T-shirts. The first and the last on actual black T-shirts worn by the same person, whose facial expression is more sad on the last one.]\nI see dumb people\nAs a matter of fact the world does revolve around me\nI can only please one person per day / today is not your day.\nYou know what your problem is? You're stupid.\nGet a clue\nDo I look like a people person?\nYour village called / they want their idiot back\nGo away\nI hate you all\nDie.\nHelp.\nMaybe if this T-shirt is witty enough, someone will finally love me.\nOh God I'm so alone."
