  "transcript": "Notes from reading Redwall books for the first time since childhood.Some of this feels familiar.\nAragorn: Hi, I'm Aragorn.\nMartin: I'm Martin.\nAragorn and Martin: I'm here to reforge my broken sword so I can lead an army against the tyrant threatening my people. I live in a world of moral absolutes and racist undertones.\nMartin: Jinx!It startled me when characters mentioned Satan.\nRedwall: \"By Satan's whiskers...\"\nRedwall mentions God/Jesus 0 times.\nRedwall mentions Satan/The Devil 4 times.\n(Harry Potter protesters, take note.)Even as a kid this bothered me: Why does everyone leave critical secret messages as simple riddles? It's silly to assume the intended recipient will be the only one to find and solve them. I would do things differently.\nMatthias: The inscription is a message from Martin!\nBrother Methuselah: What does it say?\nMatthias: Hang on, it's encrypted with my public key."
