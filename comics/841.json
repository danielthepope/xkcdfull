  "transcript": "[Cueball and Megan are talking over the telephone. The first two panels are split diagonally. Cueball is at a store, holding a box, and Megan is consulting with him.]\nCueball: Do we have an RCA-to-3.5mm female-female plug? I'm getting some speakers for the new Xbox, since the monitor doesn't have any.\nMegan: Are they crappy laptop speakers? Ugh.[Cueball is standing next to a sale rack.]\nCueball: Does it matter? I just want to hear if I'm getting shot at, not savor every detail of a beautiful musical soundscape.\nMegan: You've never heard a beautiful musical soundscape. You listen to 96kbps flv rips from YouTube.[Megan is walking.]\nCueball: Whatever. I'm just going to get these $20 speakers. Five watts will be plenty.\nMegan: Five watts for a living room sound system? Is that a joke?[Zoomed in panel on Cueball]:\nCueball: No, this is a joke: How many audiophiles does it take to change a lightbulb?\nMegan: How many?\nCueball: I'll tell you laterâ€”you wouldn't appreciate the punchline over this 12kbps cell phone codec.\nclick"
