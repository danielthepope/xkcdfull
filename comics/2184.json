Cueball is in the middle, facing out, holding his phone in both hands, while the two women face towards him with only one hand on their phones. Ponytail is tapping on the phone as shown by small lines over her fingers. they talk to each other, but before that, there is the following text above them:]\nUnpopular positive opinion challenge:\nName a movie that...\n(1) you genuinely like (not \"so bad it's good\")\n(2) came out in your adult life post-2000, and\n(3) is rated below 50% on Rotten Tomatoes.Ponytail: Wow, this is harder than I thought.\nCueball: ...Terminator Genisys?\nMegan: Seriously?!\nCueball: I like time travel, OK??When people talk about their \"unpopular opinions\" about movies, they usually mean hating something everyone likes, but liking something everyone hates is much harder."
