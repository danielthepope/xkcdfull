There's a castle on the horizon and two moons in the sky. There are a few other riders as well.][Kid, with helmet and sword, stands before King, Princess, and another warrior. Princess is holding out a ring.]\nKing: You've saved our kingdom and found your self-confidence. Now it's time to return home.
