  "transcript": "[Cueball and Megan looking out at a landscape of clouds]\nCueball: It's weird to think there are countless planets with air and stuff but no life.\nCueball: Billions of years of clouds making cool shapes with no one to look at them.[Just Cueball and Megan standing next to each other]\nMegan: Yeah, it seems like a waste. The universe getting the complex fluid dynamics right for every momentary swirl of cloud.\nMegan: Just a huge amount of work.[Cueball and Megan walk away to the right]\nCueball: Maybe atmospheres have smooth laminar flow until someone looks closely.\nMegan: Or maybe the universe just  likes  making swirly clouds, and is annoyed that we're watching."
