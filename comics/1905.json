  "transcript": "[White Hat is holding a pan by the handle pointing to the frying surface as he shows it to Cueball.]\nWhite Hat: Never clean a cast-iron pan with soap. It destroys the seasoning.\nCueball: Got it.[White Hat shift the pan to his right hand and lowers it to his side holding a finger up in front of Cueball.]\nWhite Hat: If you ever let soap touch the pan, throw it away. You're clearly not up to taking care of it.\nCueball: Wow, okay.[In a frame-less panel White Hat has taken the pan back to the first hand holding on the the edge while he holds his other hand close to the frying surface.]\nWhite Hat: Apply moisturizer to the pan daily to keep it fresh.\nCueball: ...Moisturizer?\nWhite Hat: Do you want it to get all wrinkly?\nCueball: ...I...guess not.[White Hat has shifted the pan to the second hand again holding it by the handle away from Cueball, while pointing at Cueball with the other hand.]\nWhite Hat: Twice a year, fill the pan with iron filings and leave it in direct sunlight for 24 hours.\nCueball: Wait. 24 hours of sun?\nWhite Hat: If you're not willing to travel to the Arctic, you don't deserve cast iron."
