  "transcript": "[A Cueball-like reporter and Cueball are facing each other, sitting in chairs.]\nReporter: So, Quantum Teleportation-\nCueball: The name is misleading. It's a particle statistics thing.[Zoom in on the reporter.]\nReporter: So it's not like Star Trek? That's boring.[Zoom out again to both. Cueball leaves seat and moves behind it.]\nCueball: Okay, I'm sick of this. Every time there's a paper on quantum teleportation, you reporters write the same disappointed story.[Cueball has gone to device that was behind him and was out of the scope of the three previous panels. He turns a knob that makes a sound in a zigzag sound buble.]\nReporter (Off panel): But-\nCueball: Talk to someone else. I'm going to the Bahamas. \nKnob: Click[Inserted panel with a zoom in on the device which is labeled and the knob is now turned to the right position.
