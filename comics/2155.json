  "transcript": "[The single panel comic is around 4 times higher than it is wide (317Ã—1284 pixels). A Cueball is watching from the beach while Megan with another character is standing neck deep in water near an extreme drop off (continental shelf?) and another Cueball is swimming further. This part of the comic is at the very top, and the characters are drawn much smaller than usual.]Megan: It's OK, I can still touch bottom here.[As the tall image is scrolled down, there are some deep water fish, a jellyfish, and an octopus, a bottom ledge with a beach umbrella on it, and another drop off.][Caption below the panel:]\nI love swimming, but occasionally I realize I don't know how deep the water under me is and it freaks me out."
