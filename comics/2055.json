  "transcript": "[Cueball and White Hat are talking, Cueball is holding a cell phone and wireless headphones.]\nCueball: I haven’t used a wireless/bluetooth thingy in like ten years. Is audio stuff still a nightmare?\nWhite Hat: Nah, it’s great now.[Zoom in on White Hat, Cueball is off-screen.]\nWhite Hat: You tap devices together twice to link them and they flash in sync. (It pairs using accelerometer timing and sound.) Tap them three times to disconnect.\nWhite Hat: You can pair multiple inputs and outputs and it handles it smoothly.\nCueball (off screen): Nice!\nWhite Hat: It just works. Sound comes from where you expect.\nCueball (off screen): Wonderful.[Zoom out to White Hat and Cueball facing each other.]\nWhite Hat: Haha, just kidding, it’s a nightmare.\nCueball: Noooooo!\nWhite Hat: When I connect to my car, music starts blasting from my headphones while the car repeatedly plays a “New connection!” chime.\nCueball: This is not what Josiah Bluetooth intended!"
