  "transcript": "[A phone in portrait orientation shows an image of Cueball standing. It is then rotated, showing the image smaller with bars in landscape orientation, then the next phone is in portrait showing the entire screen of the previous rotated sideways, shrinking it every time. An arrow points from each phone to the phone with the next smaller image, until the last one. The labels, at the 9th, 25th, and 101st rotation, show the decreasing size of the original image as it goes through successive rotations.][Labels:]\n9 rotations: original image is smaller than a pixel.25 rotations: original image is smaller than an atom.101 rotations: original image is smaller than the Planck length, at which the concept of distance may break down.[Bottom caption:]\nPhone tip: don't rotate and screenshot an image too many times or it will become lost in the quantum foam of the universe."
