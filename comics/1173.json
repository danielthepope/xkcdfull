The white parts in between makes it look like it irradiates light out along these lines.]\nSphere: Explain to me this \"steroid scandal.\"[Zoom in on Megan's face while she holds a hand to her chin.]\nMegan: Well, uh... \nMegan: We humans are sacks of chemicals which stay alive by finding other chemicals and putting them inside us.[Megan has turned around facing towards the Sphere to the left. She holds up one hand palm up.]\nMegan: We hold contests to see which humans are fastest and strongest.\nMegan: But some humans eat chemicals that make them too fast and strong.[Megan still facing the Sphere holds her arms out.]\nMegan: And they win contests!\nSphere: That does sound bad.\nMegan: It's awful!"
