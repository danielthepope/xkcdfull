  "transcript": "[Cueball and Megan are walking. Megan is checking her phone.]\nMegan: Reviews for The Emoji Movie are... not good.\nCueball: People are just snobs about emoji. I like them! Language is cool and weird.[Zoom on Megan; Cueball is outside of the frame.]\nMegan: It's apparently 80% product placement.\nCueball (off-screen): Whatever. So was The Lego Movie, and I liked that.[Zoom out; Cueball looks at Megan's phone.]\nMegan: It features the emoji we all know and love - with a \"Meh\" emoji in the starring role!\nCueball: Wait... a \"Meh\" emoji?\nMegan: I wondered about that, too; the others are all familiar. Do they mean üòí? Or üòê or üòï?\nCueball: That's a little confusing...[Zoom in on both heads; Megan is looking at her phone.]\nMegan: There's a joke in the movie about the \"emoji that no one uses\" that includes the eggplant emoji.\nCueball: ...was that on purpose? Or did they not run the script by enough people?[Megan and Cueball continue walking.]\nMegan: Here's a line from the Wikipedia plot summary:\nMegan: Gene and Hi-5 come to a piracy app where they meet the hacker emoji Jailbreak, who wants to reach Dropbox so that she can live in the cloud.\nCueball: Okay.\nCueball: It's possible this movie is bad."
