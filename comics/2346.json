There are 2 Cueballs each wearing masks. Inside Cueball appears to be in a doorway that leads into a building. Outside Cueball is showing Inside Cueball a phone.]\nLabel: Too Indirect\nInside Cueball: You have to come inside.\nOutside Cueball: Ok, but... I've been trying to follow the science, and they're really emphasizing the transmission risk in enclosed spaces. I know you're wearing a mask, and I feel so awkward making a scene over a tiny risk. But I'm trying to keep my overall risk acceptably low, which means having simple rules so I don't overthink every minor decision. See, if you look at this spreadsheet-[Second panel, smaller. Only the Cueball outside is shown now.]\nLabel: Direct\nOutside Cueball: I'm so sorry, but I'm avoiding shared indoor spaces unless it's an emergency.[Third panel, even smaller. Only the Cueball outside is shown.]\nLabel: Too Direct\nOutside Cueball: I'm not setting foot in your haunted plague box. "
