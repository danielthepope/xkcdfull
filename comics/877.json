  "transcript": "[Ponytail and Cueball are discussing science. They are interrupted by an off-panel shout.]\nPonytail: The problem with scientists is that you take the wonder and beauty out of everything by trying to analyze it.\nMegan (off panel): Dude![Megan runs across this frame less panel, carrying a microscope and a yellow slime mold.]\nMegan: My plasmoidal slime molds have heightened pigment production! Check out that yellow color! That actually makes them zinc-resistant. Amazing, huh?[A close up of Megan's hands holding the yellow slime mold up to Ponytail who takes her hands up to her mouth.]\nPonytail: It looks like dog barf.\nMegan (off panel): Hah, yeah! F. Septica is nicknamed \"dog vomit slime mold.\" Cool, huh? Check out my slides![Megan has set down the microscope on the floor of the panel, and the slime mold is jiggling in her hands, while Cueball watches but Ponytail looks away.]\nPonytail: Okay, never mind: What's wrong with scientists is that you do see wonder and beauty in everything.\nPonytail: Oh God, it's moving!\nMegan: It wants to hug you! So cute!"
