They are on a tiled floor with the two nearest rows of tiles fully shown, and those further back covered partly be the speech text of the ant to the right.]\nAnt: We've searched dozens of these floor tiles for several common types of pheromone trails.\nAnt: If there were intelligent life up there, we would have seen its messages by now.[Caption below the panel:]\nThe world's first ant colony to achieve sentience calls off the search for us."
