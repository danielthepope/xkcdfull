Ebooks, huh?\nCueball: Ebooks are for chumps.\nMegan: Why get a kindle, then?\nCueball: One reason:[Text is above the frame in which Cueball wanders a city with the tablet and with small bubbles forming above his head to indicate him being intoxicated.]\nCueball (narrating): Free cellular web access. Even if I spend months broke and drunk in a strange city, I'll still be able to use Wikipedia and Wikitravel to learn about anything I need.[Megan takes the tablet from Cueball.]\nMegan: Why does that sound familiar?\nMegan: Gimme that.[Zoom in on the top of the tablet where the name is written:]\nAmazon Kindle[Zoom out to Megan who scratches at the top of the tablet.] \nScrape, scrape, scrape[Zoom back to the damaged top of the tablet where a layer has been scraped off.
