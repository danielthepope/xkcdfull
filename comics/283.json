  "transcript": "[Cueball and Megan are seated on a couch, watching TV.]\nMegan: Argh, movie pet peeve- Someone sitting at a computer in the dark with the screen projected on their face. Monitors don't work like that![Cueball and Megan face each other on the couch.]\nCueball: Right - that only happens if you're in the way of a projected image. Like when we're sitting together in a parked car in the rain and the mottled light through the raindrops on the windshield makes shifting shadows on your skin...[Beat panel.][Megan stands up, Cueball uses a laptop on table behind the couch.]\nMegan: ...I wasn't really into the movie anyway.\nCueball: The nearest rainstorm's about 60 miles away.\nMegan: We'll drive fast.\nCueball: I'll grab some snacks."
