  "transcript": "[Cueball, Ponytail, and Beret Guy are standing around. Cueball and Ponytail have beach towels. Ponytail is looking at her cell phone. Beret Guy has his hands up to his face, looking distressed.]\nPonytail: We should go to the north beach. Someone said the south beach has a 20% higher risk of shark attacks.\nCueball: Yeah, but statistically, taking three beach trips instead of two increases our odds of getting shot by a swimming dog carrying a handgun in its mouth by 50%!\nBeret Guy: Oh no! This is our third trip![Caption below the panel:]\nReminder: A 50% increase in a tiny risk is still tiny."
