  "transcript": "[There is an airport security checkpoint where a queue of ten passengers is waiting to go through a backscatter x-ray scanner. Near the back of the line, Black Hat is standing next to a stand and a sign which says \"Viagra $20\". One passenger next to him is drinking a glass of water, probably after having taken the pills; another is contemplating the sign.]\nSecurity Guard (thinking): Oh god."
