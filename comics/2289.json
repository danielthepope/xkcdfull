  "transcript": "[Megan and Cueball are standing in front of a large graph, with \"Time\" along the horizontal axis and \"Bad Stuff\" along the vertical axis. The curve on the graph shows a generally shallow upward slope.]\nMegan: Our new models outline a few possible scenarios.\nCueball: #1 is the best scenario.[The graph now shows a much steeper curve, before flattening out far in the future, similar to a logistic curve.]\nMegan: Scenario 2 is not so great.[The graph now climbs quite quickly, approximating an exponential curve.]\nCueball: Scenario 3 would be pretty bad.[The graph starts curling up, like the exponential curve, but continues curving back, so that it no longer qualifies as a function, and may indicate time-travel to the past.]\nMegan: Then there is scenario 4.\nMegan: We think it's a graphing error.\nCueball: If not, we definitely want to avoid it."
