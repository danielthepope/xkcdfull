  "transcript": "[Beret Guy talking on a cell phone. The response from the person on the phone is in a jagged bubble.]\nBeret Guy: Hi, is this the shop that sells cursed items but when you try to return them the shop is gone?\nPhone: Yes, how can I help you?[A frameless panel. Beret Guy still talking on the phone]\nBeret Guy: Do you do curbside pickup? I wanted to buy a cursed amulet that angers ghosts, and some groceries.\nPhone: No, but it's okay, we wear masks.[Zoomed in on other side of Beret Guy's face]\nBeret Guy: So you can't bring stuff out?\nPhone: I'm afraid not.\nBeret Guy: But it's so stuffy in there![The callee's response is on the top of the panel. Beret Guy is now holding his phone in front of him, ready to end the call.]\nPhone: Why not think of the virus as part of the amulet's curse?\nBeret Guy: Excuse me!? I'm trying to buy some bread and do battle with ghosts, not endanger my family and friends in a pandemic! \nBeret Guy: I will take my business elsewhere."
