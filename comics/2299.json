  "transcript": "[Megan sits in an office chair at her desk with a laptop. She is leaning on the back of the chair with one arm while turning away from her desk to talk to Cueball standing behind her.]\nCueball: Hey, if you have the coronavirus genome as a text file, can you email it to me?\nMegan: Sure.\nMegan: ...Why?[Megan has turned to her her laptop typing on it, Cueball is off-panel.]\nCueball (off-panel): Nothing.\nMegan: I ... see.\nMegan: Well, here you go.\nLaptop: Click[In \"two\" frame-less panels in a row Cueball is shown twice while typing on his phone with both hands. The second time the text on his phone screen is shown above it in a square \"speech bubble\" with a \"speech line\" going down to the phone. It displays a Twitter interface, highlighting that he is trying to tweet too many characters. The last line of text in the tweet is marked with red. A number below is in red font and the + in a circle after that is in cyan font. The last word is in white font inside a cyan strip.]\nPhone: \nGAAAGGTAAGATGGAGAGGCCTTGTCCCTGGTTCAACGAGAA\n-29,602 (+) Tweet[Back to the original setting but with Megan still typing on her laptop while Cueball looks at his phone that he holds up in one hand.]\nCueball: Okay, it's too long for Twitter, but it can fit in a Facebook post.\nMegan:  Unsettling that your first instinct is \"share it online.\"\nCueball: It's cool, I sanitized my phone before posting."
