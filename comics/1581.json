  "transcript": "[Caption above the frame:]\nxkcd turns 10 years old this month.\nIn light of last night's court ruling in\nRupa Marya v. Warner/Chappell Music Inc.,\nI would just like to say:[The song text is written, with nine musical notes, three groups on each side of the text, above a birthday cake with 10 lit candles. The cake has two distinct layers. On each layer there are drawn 6 xkcd stick figures with small black bullets between them. The center bullet in the bottom layer is shaped like a heart. The figures at the edges can be difficult to recognize. The figures in the upper layer and from the left are: A man with a hat (hard to see if it is one of the recognized characters), White Hat, Megan, Pony Tail, Hairy and Cueball (hard to see him properly). Similar in the lower layer: Black Hat, Danish, Beret Guy, Rob, Cutie, and a girl (hard to see, but looks like girls hair, not a hat).]\nHappy birthday to you\nHappy birthday to you\nHappy birthday, dear xkcd\nHappy birthday to you"
