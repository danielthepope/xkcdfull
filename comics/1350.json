  "transcript": "[This transcript only transcribes what can be seen in the picture shown at the top of the explanation here.][The comic starts with two panels. In the top panel we see Knit Cap Girl sitting at a desk in front of her laptop typing. There is a speech line up to a gray but empty speech bubble.]\n[The second panel below has the same gray background as the empty speech bubble above. Here is presented four options to what Knit Cap Girl could be saying. They are marked a, b, c and d written in small white rectangles next to the text. There is a small arrow at the top pointing to the first panel:]a Hurry! We're in talks with Facebook.\nb These stupid tiles... I'll just play one more game.\nc Refresh... No new email... Refresh... No new tweets... Refresh...\nd Oh. Hey. There's some kind of political thing going on. [Once the reader chooses one of the options the text will appear in the speech bubble where the gray area is replaced with the usual white background. The lower gray panel disappears. Now the comic really begins.]\n[A new panel is shown after the selection, again with one to four options to choose from in the new gray panel below. This will continue until it comes to an end where the reader finally only has the choice to suggest the next line.][The order of the up to four options are random, and changes every time you begin again (or even go back to a previous frame). This means that the a-d in the transcript is not the same next time. In some few panels there are even more than four options. To see the fifth you have to reload, then you may find this fifth option next time. The first panel is one of those with five options.] \n[The fifth not shown above is: Let's see if BSD is any easier to install nowadays., see image with this option in the trivia section.][In the first days of the comic when it developed quickly, new options appeared only to later disappear. Gravity. Lots of it. is one of those lost options from the first panel. At one time there was also by mistake two versions of one of the other five mentioned above. But this was later deleted. Below in the trivia section there are permalinks to all the different starting options, including the now lost gravity story.][Although it may be impossible to finish? ... it has been tried to make a complete interactive transcript.]"
