I just don't know what to make of it.\n[Circles are appearing--maybe snow?]Cueball: i guess you do what you can to help the people around you and hope it turns out okay.Cueball: in the end, what else can you do?Hatted: lead a crusade?[We can no longer see the people, just the circles.]\nit's presentism, man. the idea that historical context is irrelevant, that we understand itall that we need take no warnings from the follies of the past. that we're facing something new.socrates couldn't imagine the internet. but people don't change.\n[We can start to see a darker circle in the lower right corner.](The borders between the three panels on this line are cracking.)\nhave you seen those collections of historical pornography? talk about historical context.did you know the first porn photo was bestial in.\n[inside a circle:] nature?at least that stuff was out of the mainstream\n[each word in one circle:]\nno\njust\nin\nhistory(the three panels have merged into one on each row.)i don't know about you, but\n[circled] I\n[uncircled] nevereven once seen[The circles are highly variable in size now, and pressed up against a larger one on the right side.][There is mass of circles of different sizes, with some dark fissures in between, against the side of a large circle which we can see part of in the right half of the panel. They look like cells. There's a tiny square in the center of the giant cell.][We see only the tiny square, centered. It has a few marks inside it.][Closer, the square is divided into rectangles of different sizes, each of which has text in it.][Much closer, we can see fragments of the text.
