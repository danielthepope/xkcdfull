  "transcript": "[Cueball is standing in front of three shelves with DVDs, holding a single DVD in his hand looking at the cover. A guy with a white rounded safari hat (Safari Hat from now on) stands behind him.]\nCueball: Idiocracy is so true.\nSafari Hat: I know, right? It used to be that the intelligent, upper classes had more children.[Zoom on on their heads as Cueball turns towards Safari Hat.]\nSafari Hat: Sadly, the recent reversal of this trend has dragged IQ scores and average education steadily downward.\nCueball: Depressing, huh?[Zoom out to show Cueball holding the DVD down as Safari Hat lifts on arm towards him.]\nSafari Hat: Yeah, except everything I just said was wrong.\nCueball: Huh?\nSafari Hat: Wrong. False. The opposite of true.[Zoom in only on Safari Hat.]\nSafari Hat: You're like the religious zealots who are burdened by their superiority with the sad duty of decrying the obvious moral decay of each new generation.\nSafari Hat: And you're just as wrong.[Zoom out to both as before, but this time it is Cueball who holds up a finger.]\nCueball: But look at how popular—\nSafari Hat: More harm has been done by people panicked over societal decline than societal decline ever did.[Cueball spreads out his arms (the DVD gone) as Safari Hat has walked out off the panel.]\nCueball: Look — all we need is a program that limits breeding to—\nSafari Hat (off-panel): New theory: Stupid people reproduce more because the alternative is sleeping with you."
