We're the fastest-growing religion in the country.\nBlack Hat: \"Fastest-growing\" is such a dubious claim.\nCombover: It's true! We grew by 85% over the past year.[Black Hat shouts to someone out of frame.]\nBlack Hat: Hey, Rob â€” wanna join my religion?\nRob: Sure, whatever.[Black Hat turns back to Combover and produces a notepad and pen.]\nBlack Hat: Well, looks like my religion grew by 100% this year.[Black Hat begins to walk away.]\nCombover: We have 38,000 members!\nBlack Hat: Hope they're all ok with second place."
