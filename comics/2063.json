The label is:]\n1. Isometric Expansion\nWhen heated, the gas becomes larger due to increasing volume[The next line starts at the last point and goes downwards and a little to the right.]\n2. Isotonic Expansion\nThe gas expands further due to dark energy while percent milkfat remains constant[The next line starts at this last point and goes to the left and slightly upwards.]\n3. Isopropyl Compression\nWhile inflation is held constant, the gas contracts due to tightening interest rates[The last line goes upwards and slightly to the left, returning to the first point.]\n4.
