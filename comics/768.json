  "transcript": "[Cueball is going through a cardboard box marked \"MISC\", and finds a catalog. Megan looks on.]\nCueball: Check it out - old Computer Shoppers! Wow - in 1996, $3,000 would get you a 100 MHz Pentium system with a parallel port, two serial ports, a 2MB video card, and \"MS-Windows\"\nMegan: Nice![The two are face-to-face, and they each have a separate copy of Computer Shopper.]\nMegan: And $299 would get you a Palm Pilot 100- - 16MHz, 128Kb storage, and a memo pad, calendar, and state-of-the-art address book that can store over 100 names!\nCueball: Oooh![Cueball continues to read from his.]\nCueball: And $110 would get you a bulky TI graphing calculator with around 10MHz CPU, 24Kb RAM, and a 96x64-pixel B/W display!\nMegan: Times sure have... ...have... uh.[They both put down their catalogs.]\nCueball: Okay, what the hell, T.I.?\nMegan: Maybe they cost so much now because there's only one engineer left who remembers how to make displays that crappy."
