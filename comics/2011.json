  "transcript": "[The panel shows a shaded sphere with a rocket launched from its top to the right. Several trajectories are plotted around the sphere.][Trajectory 1 (in black) shows a successful circular orbit.]\nHumans slip the bonds of Earth to travel the stars[Trajectory 2 (in red) shows a ballistic arc that crashes into the sphere near the bottom.]\nCivilization ends in fire[Trajectory 3 (in red) shows a much shorter ballistic arc. No label.][Caption below the panel:]\nIn retrospect, Newton's little cannonball drawing does a surprisingly good job illustrating the range of possible futures of our species."
