Making you happy isn't my greatest dream.[Cueball places the items in an even bigger pile of even more random items.]\nCueball: Your smile is not all I live for. I've got my own stuff going on. But you're strange and fascinating and I've never met anyone like you.[Cueball stares in awe as Megan assembles the items into a gargantuan, intoxicatingly complex machine.]\nCueball: I want to give you everything just to see what you would do with it."
