Black Hat has his hands on his hips.]\nBlack Hat: I finished my time machine, but it's one-use-only.\nCueball: You gotta kill Hitler.[Close-up of Black Hat, one hand palm upward.]\nBlack Hat: Why are you so obsessed with this Hitler guy? We have all of time we could explore![Close-up of Cueball with both hands palm upward.]\nCueball: He's evil incarnate! He murdered millions and sparked global war! Everyone agreesâ€”if you get a time machine, you kill Hitler.[Black Hat enters the now open Time door as the other man looks on..]\nBlack Hat: Fine, fine, I get it! Calm down. BRB, killing Hitler.[Black Hat returns, shutting the door with one hand. Cueball has outstretched arms.]\nBlack Hat: There. Done. Are you happy? \nCueball: Thank you.\nBlack Hat: He was in some kind of bunker. 1945 was loud!\nCueball: NO!"
