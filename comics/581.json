  "transcript": "[Nathan skates in.]\nNathan: So you took care of him?\nSummer: I can extrude hair, but I  can't retract it.\nNathan: That a yes?\n[Summer grabs Nathan's arm as he skates past her, pulling him off the board.]\nNathan: Bwah!\n[An Andy Capp-esque meleè dust cloud.]\nWHAP BAM POW WHAM\n[Summer skates away.]\n[A beat-up Nathan approaches an similarly battered Cueball.]\nNathan: She may have my board, but I can still beat you to the finish line if I bring you down.\nCueball: Bring it, Captain Tightpants.\nNathan: I've got nothing to  bring. I just said that so she could get behind you.\n[Cueball turns.]\nCueball: Who—\n[Cueball is hit with his board.]\nWHAM\n[Nathan stands over a prone Cueball.]\nNathan: I just said that so I could get behind you. The serious fans always fall for the quotes.\n[Wide panel of Summer crossing the finishing line on Nathan's board, breaking through the tape.]\nAnnouncer: And the winner is...\nOff-screen voice: Summer Glau?\nSummer: I swallowed a bug again.\n[Close-up of Cueball's beaten face.]\nCueball: All right, Fillion. I've had enough of your treachery and ...rugged good looks. This ends here.\n[Equally close-up: Nathan's face, bearing several grazes.]\nNathan: All right, fanboy. Let this be our final battle. \n[They rush at each other, fists ready to swing punches.]\nFinal battle canceled by Fox.\nTry an Internet petition drive - those totally work."
