  "transcript": "[Cueball is standing between Ponytail and Megan talking to them.]\nCueball: I always thought of Brussels sprouts as terrible, but they're actually really good! I can't believe I let everyone mislead me![In a frame-less panel Megan replies. Below her is a footnote with a citation to back up her statement.]\nMegan: It's not just you! Farmers developed a less-bitter cultivar like 15 years ago.*\n*npr.org/773457637[Back to all three as Megan continues to explain while holding her arms away from her.]\nMegan: Now the whole world is having this revelation, one person at a time. It's like a real Mandela effect. We secretly switched to the parallel universe where Brussels sprouts taste good.\nCueball: Cool.[Ponytail lifts a finger as Cueball and Megan turns to look at her.]\nPonytail: Also, licorice is good now.\nCueball: Whoa, really?\nMegan: This is a trap.\nPonytail: And those silica gel packets that say \"Do not eat\"? Delicious.\nCueball: I knew it."
