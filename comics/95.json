  "transcript": "[A large triangle, point down, is shown, with many smaller triangles inside all pointing up. There is one large triangle in the middle, with 3 medium triangles on either side, with three  triangles on either of their sides as well for a total of 9. This trend then continues three more times with 27 around the nine, and 81 around those and finally there was supposed to be 243 (3x81) very small filling out all the space outside the larger triangles, but staying inside the original triangle. But there seem to be missing three of these near the top. Two of those are on either side of the first (top left) of the nine triangles of size 3 as well as one to the left of the top of the top right second largest triangle. But there are also one extra triangle just below the P in the bottom triangle with a sentence. That would have been the first of the next level of 3*243=729 triangles in level 7. But it is the only one. So 240 small triangles plus 1 even tinier for a total of 362 inside the largest framing triangle).] [There is a word inside the largest of the triangles and a sentence in the largest triangle below that triangle.]\nPenis! \nHaha, penis."
