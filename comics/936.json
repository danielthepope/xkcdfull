  "transcript": "The comic illustrates the relative strength of passwords assuming basic knowledge of the system used to generate them.\nA set of boxes is used to indicate how many bits of entropy a section of the password provides.\nThe comic is laid out with 6 panels arranged in a 3x2 grid.\nOn each row, the first panel explains the breakdown of a password, the second panel shows how long it would take for a computer to guess, and the third panel provides an example scene showing someone trying to remember the password.[The password \"Tr0ub4dor&3\" is shown in the center of the panel. A line from each annotation indicates the word section the comment applies to.]Uncommon (non-gibberish) base word\n[Highlighting the base word - 16 bits of entropy.]\nCaps?\n[Highlighting the first letter - 1 bit of entropy.]\nCommon Substitutions\n[Highlighting the letters 'a' (substituted by '4') and both 'o's (the first of which is substituted by '0') - 3 bits of entropy.]\nPunctuation\n[Highlighting the symbol appended to the word - 4 bits of entropy.]\nNumeral\n[Highlighting the number appended to the word - 3 bits of entropy.]\nOrder unknown\n[Highlighting the appended characters - 1 bit of entropy.]\n(You can add a few more bits to account for the fact that this is only one of a few common formats.)~28 bits of entropy \n228 = 3 days at 1000 guesses/sec\n(Plausible attack on a weak remote web service. Yes, cracking a stolen hash is faster, but it's not what the average user should worry about.)\nDifficulty to guess: Easy[Cueball stands scratching his head trying to remember the password.]\nCueball: Was it trombone? No, Troubador. And one of the O's was a zero?\nCueball: And there was some symbol...\nDifficulty to remember: Hard[The passphrase \"correct horse battery staple\" is shown in the center of the panel.]\nFour random common words {Each word has 11 bits of entropy.}~44 bits of entropy\n244 = 550 years at 1000 guesses/sec\nDifficulty to guess: Hard[Cueball is thinking, in his thought bubble a horse is standing to one side talking to an off-screen observer. An arrow points to a staple attached to the side of a battery.]\nHorse: That's a battery staple.\nObserver: Correct!\nDifficulty to remember: You've already memorized itThrough 20 years of effort, we've successfully trained everyone to use passwords that are hard for humans to remember, but easy for computers to guess."
