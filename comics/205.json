  "transcript": "When it came to eating strips of candy buttons, there were two main strategies. Some kids carefully removed each bead, checking closely for paper residue before eating.\n[To the right, a small section of a strip of Candy Buttons paper is shown. Two red buttons have been removed from the top of the strip.]\n\n[To the left, a long strip is shown. It seems to be waving in the air.]\nOthers tore the candy off haphazardly, swallowing large scraps of paper as they ate.\n\nThen there were the lonely few of us who moved back and forth on the strip, eating rows of beads here and there, pretending we were Turing machines.\n[A strip is shown from bird's eye view. Many rows of buttons have already been eaten.]"
