  "transcript": "[Ponytail stands in front of an image with a white section in the shape of the 7 rows of the periodic table  of the elements, but without the two rows usually shown beneath with the lanthanides and actinides. The “empty” sections at the top of the table are filled with three rows of dotted boxes, 16 boxes in the top row and two rows with 10 boxes each, shifted one right from the top row. Ponytail points to this area with a pointer while she looks and gestures towards an off-panel audience.]\nPonytail: I don't know why no one else thought to look here. [Caption below the panel]:\nThe 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry went to the team that discovered the elements in the big gap at the top of the periodic table."
