  "transcript": "[Single wide frame representing a basketball court with a basketball goal at each end.  There are seven players running around the court, with a virtual ball in the bottom right corner (indicated by being drawn as a dashed circle).  Nine off-screen voices of \"online viewers\" are yelling instructions to the players.  A caption is below the frame running nearly the full width of the frame.]Viewer One: No!\nViewer Two: It's on the–\nViewer Three: Look out!\n[A player with thick hair and a goatee is \"air-shooting\" into the left-hand basket.]\nViewer Four: No!\n[A player with thick hair is running to the right.]\nViewer Five: He's right there. Don’t run into–\n[A player with no hair is air-dribbling to the right.]\nViewer Six: Riiight!\nViewer Seven: Go left!\nViewer Eight: Left!\n[A player with thick hair and a full beard is facing left and jumping, hands raised to intercept a ball.]\n[A player with no hair is facing left and crouching, reaching for a ball.]\n[A player is making an alley-oop motion towards the right-hand basket.]\nViewer Nine: Stop dunking and find the ball!\n[The virtual ball is slowly moving right, unseen by the players]\n[A player is hanging on the rim of the basket, making a dunking motion.][Caption below the panel:]\nNo one liked my new sports system, in which each player is in a separate arena sharing a single virtual ball that they can't see while online viewers yell instructions, but it was fun to watch while it lasted."
