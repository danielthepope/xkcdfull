  "transcript": "[Cueball and Megan are looking at a rock that Megan is holding up in one hand.]\nMegan: This rock erupted from a volcano near the South Pole when the world was frozen over, just before multicellular life arose.[Zoom out reveals that Cueball and Megan are standing on the beach of a bay with hills in the background. The water surface is quite flat without any waves. Megan throws the rock which skips 5 times across the water before it sinks.]\nStone: Skip Skip Skip Skip Skip Plunk[Zoom back on Cueball and Megan who are still looking in the direction she threw the stone.]\nMegan: Now it'll be covered in sediment that becomes a new rock layer. It will likely stay buried until it melts down, erodes away, or the earth is consumed by the sun.[Cueball and Megan still looking the same way.]\nCueball: Today was a weird day in its incredibly long life.\nMegan: Five brief skips, then eons of darkness.\nCueball: Five is a lot, though!\nMegan: It was a good throw."
