  "transcript": "[In a dark panel, Megan is a TV host standing in front of a group of 5 people: two Cueballs, Ponytail, Hairbun and a Megan-like woman.]\nHost: Welcome back to stargazing.\nHost: When the stars disappeared this morning, I figured I had to find a new job, but they're back! This rules![A frame-less white panel in which the host points to the upper right with the Megan-like woman, Ponytail and Cueball looking in that direction.]\nHost: Those three stars form a constellation called the triangle.\nHost: Those three are another triangle.\nHost: Lotta triangles. Very important shape.[Back to a dark panel with the host now pointing to the upper left in a close-up.]\nHost: Those dots are planets, or \"fool's stars.\" Without interstellar travel, they're the only ones we can realistically hope to dump trash on.\nHost: Speaking of space trash, that dot is a satellite. There are apps that will tell you whose fault it is.[The host is now turned right not pointing, still in a close-up.]\nOff-panel voice: What's that blinking one?\nHost: Airplane. They're full of snacks and money and stuff, but don't bother trying to catch them- they're way too high up.\nHost: Learned that the hard way in grad school.\nHost: Got a thesis out of it, at least."
