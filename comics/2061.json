  "transcript": "[Cueball is standing behind Ponytail, who is sitting on the floor playing a video game on a TV which displays a diagram of tectonic plates.]\nCueball: What game is that?\nPonytail: Tectonics!\nPonytail: You steer chunks of crust around, rifting, subducting, and building and eroding mountains.[A view of the game screen is shown. It includes a large cross-section of the Earth with smaller charts around it.]\nPonytail (narrating): You try to keep your climate stable and your biosphere rich. \nPonytail (narrating): Avoid making large igneous provinces! They're the worst.[Cueball holds his hand out in a frameless panel.]\nCueball: Cool!\nCueball: Can I try?\nPonytail (off-panel): Sure![Cueball plays the game while Ponytail watches.]\nCueball: ...How do I unpause?\nPonytail: It's not paused.\nCueball: ...\nPonytail: Continents can only move a few inches per year.[Cueball has stopped playing and holds the controller in one hand. Ponytail points at the screen that shows an achievement page with no completed achievements, but a progress bar halfway done for an achievement with the number 1 and a mountain.]\nCueball: It's real-time?\nPonytail: Just 400 millennia to go until your first mountain achievement!"
