  "transcript": "[Megan sits at a desk in front of a computer, looking to the left off-panel and pointing at the screen]\nMegan: Have you seen this big comet, C/2014 UN271? It'll pass near Saturn's orbit in 10 years.\n[Cueball stands behind Megan, who is now looking at the computer and typing]\nCueball: Wow, look at the orbital period.\nMegan: Yeah, it hasn't been to this part of the solar system since humans evolved. At least.\n[Cueball starts running off-panel, holding his finger in the air. Megan looks towards him with both arms resting on the back of her chair]\nCueball: Well, we definitely need to tidy up. I'll start on the Pacific Garbage Patch, you tackle orbital debris.\nMegan: What about the moon footprints?\nCueball: Sweep them up. Collect the Mars rovers, too! We can put them back once it's gone."
