  "transcript": "By any reasonable definition, T. rex is more closely related to sparrows than to Stegosaurus.\n[Diagram showing that Stegosaurus came earlier than T. rex, along with it showing that T. rex came closer in time to sparrows. Evaluation criteria \"separation by time\", \"phylogenetic distance\" and \"physical similarity\" are highlighted in red.]\nBirds aren't descended from dinosaurs, they are dinosaurs.\nWhich means that the fastest animal alive today is a small carnivorous dinosaur, Falco peregrinus.\n[A picture of two birds is shown.]\nIt preys mainly on other dinosaurs, which it strikes and kills in midair with its claws.\n[In red:] This is a good world."
