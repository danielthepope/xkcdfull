  "transcript": "[Ponytail points with a stick at a graph hanging on the wall. It depicts a collision of two apples producing a banana, a bunch of grapes, a cherry, three strawberries, and one product which is too small to distinguish clearly but which may be a single grape or berry.]\nPonytail: When two apples collide, they can briefly form exotic new fruit. Pineapples with apple skin. Pomegranates full of grapes. Watermelon-sized peaches.\nPonytail: These normally decay into a shower of fruit salad, but by studying the debris, we can learn what was produced.\nPonytail: Then, the hunt is on for a stable form.[Caption below the panel:] \nHow new types of fruit are developed"
