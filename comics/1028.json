  "transcript": "[White Hat looks down at a large gap in the walkway; a thought bubble with a warning symbol and an image of the gap appears above his head.][White Hat walks to the right, away from the gap, and encounters Hairy, to which he speaks (in iconographic speech bubble form) while pointing toward the gap, attempting to inform him about the gap. A thought bubble appears above Hairy's head with an image of White Hat pointing.][White Hat continues, waving his arms, still talking about the gap. Hairy's thought bubble continues to contain images of White Hat, now gesturing frantically.][Hairy shrugs in a nonplussed manner, and White Hat leaves off the right side of the frame. Both have thought bubbles displaying the other's reaction.][White Hat continues to the right and comes across Megan. He tells her about the reaction of Hairy (still all in iconographic form); she simultaneously tries to tell him about a gap and gestures off to the right of the frame.][White Hat and Megan both leave the frame. Megan exits left thinking of White Hat's reactions; White Hat exits to the right while thinking about both Hairy and Megan's reactions.][Megan (still thinking about White Hat) encounters Hairy (who is also still thinking about White Hat).][Megan and Hairy talk about White Hat.][Megan and Hairy (now without his hair) continue talking about White Hat as they exit the frame to the left.][A commotion is heard from the left.]\nExplosion to the left: !!! ** !![Megan and Hairy (still without his hair) have fallen into the gap in the walkway. A commotion is then also heard from the right.]\nExplosion to the right: !!! ** *[White Hat has fallen into another gap.][Beret Guy looks down at a large gap in the walkway; a thought bubble with a warning symbol and an image of the gap appears above his head.][Beret Guy runs off the frame to the right.][Beret Guy meets Cueball and reaches out to him. He tells him (still in iconographic form) that Cueball should take Beret Guy's hand. Cueball has a thought bubble of Beret Guy with his arm stretched out.][Beret Guy takes Cueball's hand and leads him along to the left. Cueball's thought bubble has two question marks around Beret Guy.]\nCueball: ? ?[Beret Guy leads Cueball to the gap and points it out to him.][Beret Guy and Cueball walk away from the gap to the right, now both thinking about the gap with a warning symbol above it.]"
