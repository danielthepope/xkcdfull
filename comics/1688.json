  "transcript": "[A very complicated flow chart, which can only be read in detail using the larger image now shown at the top of this page. This transcript uses the large version, where there is no problem reading all entries.][At the top of the chart there is a large caption, with a smaller caption below:]\nGuide to figuring out the age of an undated world map\n(Assuming it's complete, labeled in English, and detailed enough)[Below the starting bracket in the small caption is a start box. It has rounded corners and it is gray with white text. From this box there is a gray line to a box consisting of a black frame with rounded corners. In these kind of boxes there are questions regarding the map in black text. Below this box there are three gray boxes like the start box, superimposed over the bottom frame. In these boxes are the possible answers to the question in the frame above. From each of these options there is a gray line going to similar black framed boxes with other questions either below, or to either side. There can either be two, three or four gray boxes, two the most common. Only at the very bottom of the central branch where it turns out it was a home made map, are there two frames with only one gray question box each. This trend continues over this entire large image. When reaching the end of a branch in the flow chart, there is no line away from one, more or all of the gray boxes for a black frame. When this happens a year range or a guess at what the map shows, or what it is (if it turns out to not be a map) is written below the gray box in gray text. Of the text in the gray boxes are Yes/No, but not always. There are 74 boxes with black frames with 158 gray boxes and 78 endpoints with text below the gray box and one end point without text below (the one with the home made map).]Start\nIstanbul or Constantinople?\nConstantinople\nDo any of these exist? \nIndependent Canada\nUS Territory of Alaska\nTokyo\nNo\nThe Holy Roman Empire?\nYes\n1805 or earlier (before this point, the modern idea of a complete political map of the world gets hard to apply.)\nNo\nThe United States?\nNo\nHow sure are you that this map is in english?\nYes\nTexas is...\nPart of Mexico\nFlorida is part of...\nSpain\nParaguay?\nNo 1806–10\nYes 1811–17\nThe US\nVenezuela and/or ecuador?\nNo 1818–29\nYes 1830–33\nIndependent 1834–45\nPart of the US\nDoes Russia border the Sea of Japan?\nNo\nThe US's southern border looks...\nWeird 1846–53\nNormal 1854–56\nYes 1858–67\nYes\nSouth Africa?\nNo\nRhodesia?\nNo\nIs Bolivia landlocked?\nNo\n\"Buda\" and \"Pest\" or \"Budapest\"?\nBuda and Pest 1868–72\nBudapest 1873–83\nYes 1884–95\nYes\nIs Norway part of Sweden?\nYes 1896–1905\nNo 1906–09\nYes\nAustria-Hungary?\nYes\nAlbania?\nNo 1910–12\nYes 1913–18\nNo\nLeningrad?\nNo 1919–23\nYes 1924–29\nNeither\nDoes the Ottoman Empire exist?\nYes #canada-alaska-tokyo\nNo\nThe Soviet Union?\nYes\nSaudi Arabia?\nYes\nIs most of West Africa a giant french blob?\nYes\nPakistan?\nNo\nHow many Germanys are there?\nOne\nPersia or Iran?\nPersia 1930–34\nIran 1935–40\nOne, but it's huge 1941–45\nTwo 1946–47\nYes\nCambodia?\nNo\nEritrea is part of...\nItaly\nCanada is...\nMissing a piece 1948\nFine 1949–52\nEthiopia 1952–53\nYes\nThe United Arab Republic?\nNo 1954–57\nYes 1958–60\nNo\nHow many Vietnams are there?\nTwo\nBangladesh?\nNo\nIs the area south of Lake Victoria...\nBritish\nThe town on I-25 between Albuquerque and El Paso is...\nHot Springs 1948–49\nTruth or Consequences 1950–52\nTanganyika 1961–64\nTanzania 1965–71\nYes 1972–75\nOne\nJimmy Carter is...\nBeing attacked by a giant swimming rabbit April 20, 1979\nFine\nThe Sinai is part of what country?\nIsrael 1976–79\nMostly Israel 1980\nMostly Egypt 1981\nEgypt\nWhat's the capital of Micronesia?\nKolonia\nRepublic of the Upper Volta or Burkina Faso?\nUpper Volta 1982–84\nBurkina Faso 1985–88\nPalikir\n(number of Yemens) + (number of Germanys) = ?\nFour 1989-early 1990\nThree mid-1990\nTwo late 1990–1991\nNo 1922–1932\nNo\nNorth Korea?\nYes\nZaire? or: \"Hong Kong (UK)\"\nYes 1992–96\nNo\nSerbia/Montenegro are...\nOne country\nEast Timor?\nNo 1997–2001\nYes 2002–06\nTwo countries\nHow many Sudans are there?\nOne 2007–11\nTwo\nIs Crimea disputed?\nYes\n\"Colorado\" or \"Danger—Radioactive Exclusion Zone—Avoid\"?\nColorado 2014–21\nDanger\nDoes the warning mention the spiders?\nNo 2022\nYes 2023 or later\nNo 2012–13\nNo\nSaint Trimble's Island\nNo\nIs Jan Mayen part of the Kingdom of Norway?\nNot yet\n#canada-alaska-tokyo\nWhat?\nCan you see the familiar continents?\nYes\nThis sounds like a physical map or satellite photo.\nYes, that's it\nIs Lake Chad missing?\nNo\nHow far east do the American Prairies reach?\nIndiana before 1830\nThe Mississippi 1830s-80s\nNebraska\nIs there a big lake in the middle of Southern California?
