  "transcript": "[Megan is standing behind Cueball sitting at a desk using his laptop.]\nMegan: What are you doing?\nCueball: Trying the Windows 7 beta.\nMegan: Why is it showing a picture of Hitler?\n[The laptop's screen is shown with Adolf Hitler's face on it, drawn in regular xkcd style with no facial features other than his hairstyle and mustache.]\nCueball: I don't know. I can't get it to do anything else.\nMegan: There's no UI?\nCueball: No, just Hitler.\n[Return to the original scene, except Megan is now scratching her head in confusion.]\nMegan: Did you try Ctrl-Alt-Delete?\nCueball: It just makes Hitler's eyes flash.\nMegan: Huh.\n[Scene remains basically the same, except Megan is no longer scratching her head and Cueball is no longer typing on the laptop.]\nMegan: Well, it's better than Vista.\nCueball: True."
