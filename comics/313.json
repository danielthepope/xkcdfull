The alarm clock is the brightest. Can't sleep I'm alone with those glowing red numbers\n[The clock now shows 4:32]\nTime slows\nDoes time even exist here?\nThoughts churning in on themselves\n[The clock now shows 4:33]\nThe madness can't be far away\nAh yes\n[The clock now shows 13:72]\nThere it is."
