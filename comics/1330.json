People say that's why the miners sealed the well and abandoned the project.Black Hat: Why would anyone believe that story?\nMegan: I guess some people think Hell is literally an underground place.Black Hat: No - I mean, why would the miners seal the opening? Why not just dig a canal connecting it to the ocean? Unless they like Hell.Megan: ...If there's ever a war between Earth and Hell, I hope I'm on your side.\nBlack Hat: You seem nice; you probably won't be."
