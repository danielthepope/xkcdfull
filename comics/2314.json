  "transcript": "[Cueball and Megan are walking next to each other towards the left with Megan looking back at Cueball.]\nMegan: Have you heard of \"carcinization\"?\nMegan: The tendency of nature to evolve things into crabs.\nCueball: Oh?[They continue to walk, both of them looking forward.]\nMegan: Yeah, the basic \"crab\" design has evolved separately a number of times.\nCueball: Evolution just loves making crabs, I guess![Narrower panel with only Megan seen walking on while lifting both her arms slightly to each side.]\nMegan: Apparently![Two smaller beat panels are drawn between the previous and next normal sized panels. The first is a bit lower than the top of the normal panels, and is partly lying in over the other small panel, which is below and to the right of the first. The top panel shows Megan continuing to walk along.  The second shows Megan stopping and turning to look back.][Megan has turned completely and is looking down at a small crab scuttling along on the ground where Cueball was before.]\nMegan: Oh no"
