  "transcript": "[Megan sits at a desk, working on a laptop. A genome sequence is displayed on her laptop screen, shown with a jagged line in a text bubble.]\nCueball (off-screen): So that's the coronavirus genome, huh?\nMegan: It is!\nLaptop: <A long string of unintelligible letters, presumably the genome>[Cueball walks up and stands behind Megan, still working on the laptop.]\nCueball: It's weird that you can just look at it in a text editor.\nMegan: It's essential!\nMegan: We geneticists do most of our work in Notepad.[A frameless panel, Cueball still standing behind Megan. Megan rests her arm on the chair. ]\nCueball: Notepad?\nMegan: Yup! Nicer labs use Word, which lets you change the genome font size and make nucleotides bold or italic.\nCueball: Ah, okay.\nMegan: That extra formatting is called \"epigenetics\".[A regular panel. Cueball still stands behind Megan, this time with his hand on his chin.]\nCueball: Hey, why does that one have a red underline?\nMegan: When we identify a virus, we add its genome to spellcheck. That's how we spot mutations.\nCueball: Clever!"
