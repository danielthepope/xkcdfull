  "transcript": "[In a dark panel, Megan as a TV host stands in front of a group of people: Science Girl, Ponytail and Cueball. The panel is inverse-colored, i.e. white text and drawings on black]\nHost: Welcome back to Stargazing.\nHost: There are no new stars since last time, but you came back for some reason.[Zoomed out on the same scene, the host is now with Science Girl, Ponytail, Cueball, a Megan-like woman, and White Hat. The host is pointing upwards with her left hand.]\nHost: That star is Vega. At magnitude 0.03, it's the brightest star I'm currently talking about.\nHost: That one is Polaris. It's over the North Pole, which is all it has going for it.[A frame-less white panel, zoomed in on the host, who is now pointing upwards with her right hand.]\nHost: That's a comet. Some of them come back every few decades, no matter how much I yell at them.\nHost: But stargazing isn't all fun yelling. We face a problem even worse than comets: light pollution.[Back to a dark panel, the host now has a big bag of crossbows. The bag has a logo of a crossbow with stars around it. She has taken out one of them and is holding it in her right hand.]\nHost: The sky is going away because people keep shining lights at it. The new LEDs are even worse - they're too blue, and you can't turn them off by throwing rocks at them like with the old ones.\nHost: Luckily, I brought these astronomy crossbows.\nHost: Take one, then let's fan out and look for lamps."
