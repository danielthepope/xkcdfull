  "alt": "I like the idea of cartograms (distorted population maps), but I feel like in practice they often end up being the worst of both worldsâ€”not great for showing geography OR counting people. And on top of that, they have all the problems of a chloro... chorophl... chloropet... map with areas colored in.",

  "transcript": "[A map of the United States, with Hawaii and Alaska offset, is shown. Across the states red, blue and green Cueball like stick figure are scattered about, much more on each coast, and very few in the central parts, especially in the mid west. There are about the same amount of red and blue stick figures. There are not many green, but they are represented almost in any state with more than 10 stick figures.  Above the map there is a large bold title. Below that there is a legend description explaining the red, blue and green Cueball stick figure with labels of who they represent next to them. Below this, in light gray text, are two lines of explanation of how the map was created:]\n2016 Election Map\nEach figure represents 250,000 votes\n[Red stick figure:] Trump\n[Blue stick figure:] Clinton\n[Green stick figure:] Other\nBased on 2016 election results\nVotes are distributed by states as accurately as possible while keeping national totals correct.\nLocation within each state is approximate."
