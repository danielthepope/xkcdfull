  "transcript": "[Black Hat is sitting in an office chair at a when Hairy runs up behind him with his arms raised up.]\nHairy: Monkey tacos! \nHairy: I'm so random.[A frame-less panel pans to Black Hat and his desk, showing there is a computer on his desk and that he is actually typing on a keyboard in front of him on a lowered shelf.]\nBlack Hat: Yeah, me too.[Black Hat swings in his chair around (as shown with a gray curved line beneath the chair at his feet) to face Hairy. Then he emits a massive speech bubble filled with gray random numbers that seems to emanate fro his mouth and then blow up. This torrent of random numbers knock Hairy to the ground as he shields his face with one arm while the other grasp for the floor to cushion the fall. Speech bubbles are not used normally, and in this one an arrow points at Black Hat's mouth. Where the arrow stops and the bubble \"blows\" up is the first number. But then there are two numbers in the next column and then three and so forth but as the numbers also grow bigger there are less numbers at the right side of the panel, than if they had stayed the same size. About 8-9 numbers are there above each other where the bubble leaves the panel. There is no numbers fully inside Hairy's head, although they do overlap where his arm comes up. It is for many reason difficult to read them in a particular order, but for reason explained above, there is actually some order, and using that order they should appear like this:]\nBlack Hat: [With Hairy gone Black Hat has turned back and resumed working at his computer.]"
