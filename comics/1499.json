Hairy is taking chips from the bowl on the table with one hand, and his other hand is dropping chips into a large bag behind him. Cueball is double facepalming.]\nHairy: They're the ones giving chips away!\nHairy: If they don't see the arbitrage potential, sucks for them.\n[On the bag is written: Chips.]In a deep sense, society functions only because we generally avoid taking these people out to dinner."
