  "transcript": "[Cueball is standing and straining backwards, dragging a large sack nearly the size as him, with noticeable bulges. It is placed on top of two long, flat boxes on top of a flat, four-wheeled trolley. Motion lines indicate the trolley is rolling towards Cueball and his hands are shaking. Cueball is also wearing a large backpack with multiple compartments. The backpack, boxes and sack are all labelled \"EDC\"][Caption under the panel:]\nIt was hard work collecting all the everyday carry products on the Internet, but now I'm finally ready for anything."
