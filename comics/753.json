  "transcript": "\"The great battlefield for the defense and expansion of freedom today is the whole southern half of the globe - Asia, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East.\"\n-John F. Kennedy, 1961 speech to Congress.[An ovoid world map, with Latin America colored in red, Africa in yellow, the Middle East in green, and Asia in Blue.
