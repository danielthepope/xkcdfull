  "transcript": "US Space Team's Up Goer Five\nThe only flying space car that's taken anyone to another world (explained using only the ten hundred words people use the most often)\n[A list of Saturn-V parts, top to bottom, with their \"Up Goer\" description follows.]\n[Launch Escape System (LES)]: Thing to help people escape really fast if there's a problem and everything is on fire so they decide not to go to space\n[LES side nozzle]: Thing to control which direction the escaping people go\n[LES fuel]: Stuff to burn to make the box with the people in it escape really fast\n[LES bottom nozzles]: Place where fire comes out to help them escape\n[Apollo spacecraft.]\n[Command Module (CM)]: Part that flies around the other world and comes back home with the people in it and fall in the water.\n[CM capsule parts]: People box, door, chairs\n[Service Module (SM)]: Part that goes along to give people air, water, computers and stuff. It comes back home with them but burns up without landing.\n[SM oxygen tanks]: Cold air for burning (and breathing). This part had a VERY big problem once.\n[Lunar Module (LM)]: Part that flies down to the other world with two people inside\n[LM descent stage]: Part that stays on the other world (it's still there)\n[LM feet]: Feet that go on the ground of the other world\n[Instrument Unit]: Ring holding most of the computers\n[S-IVB third stage]: Part that falls off third (this part flew away from our world into space and hit the world we were going toward)\n[Fuel tanks]: Wet and very cold\n[Liquid hydrogen (LH2) tank]: The kind of air that once burned a big sky bag and people died and someone said \"Oh, the [humans]!\" (used for burning)\n[Liquid oxygen (LOX) tank]: The part of air you need to breathe, but not the other stuff (used for burning)\n[Helium pressurizing tanks]: Things holding that kind of air that makes your voice funny (it's for filling up the space left when they take the cold air out to burn it.)\n[J-2 engine nozzle]: Fire comes out here\n[S-II second stage]: Part that falls off second\n[LH2 tank]: More sky bag air (for burning) (cold + wet)\n[LOX tank]: More breathing-type air (for burning) (cold + wet)\n[Tank-to-engine fuel lines]: Thing that brings in cold wet air to burn\n[J-2 engine nozzles (qty. 5)]: Fire comes out here\n[S-IC first stage]: Part that falls off first\n[LOX tank]: More breathing-type air (for burning) (cold + wet)\n[Helium pressurizing tank]: More funny voice air (for filling up space)\n[LOX fill line]: Opening for putting in cold wet air\n[RP-1 fuel tank]: This is full of that stuff they burned in lights before houses had power.It goes together with the cold air when it's time to start going up.\n[F-1 engine nozzles (qty. 5)]: Lots of fire comes out here.\n[Bottom of spacecraft]: This end should point toward the ground if you want to go to space. If it starts pointing toward space you are having a bad problem and you will not go to space today."
