  "transcript": "[The comic shows the facades of four stores next to each other on a street, with the sidewalk shown in front of them. To the top of each store's name there has been appended white signs. Three of the white signs partially cover the name part of the sign above three of the stores, but the fourth sign is placed entirely above the text of the third store. Thus that white sign's top is higher up than the building's.][First store from the left. The top line of two on the store's sign is obscured by the white sign:] \nWhite sign: All-you-can-eat\nStore sign: Discount Tires[Second store from the left. The top line of two on the store's sign is obscured by the white sign:]  \nWhite sign: All-you-can-eat\nStore sign: Hair Salon[Third store from the left. The white sign on this store is slightly tilted, and most of it is above the top of the store completely above the store sign:]\nWhite sign: All-you-can-eat\nStore sign: Lumber and \nStore sign: Flooring Depot[Fourth store from the left. The top line of two on the store's sign is obscured by the white sign. However, the name can still be deduced, and the top line says \"Kevin's\".]\nWhite sign: All-you-can-eat\nStore sign: Pet Store[Caption below the frame:]\nMy hobby: Going out at night and adding \"all-you-can-eat\" to every store's sign"
