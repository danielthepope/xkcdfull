  "transcript": "I wanted to make you a science valentine\nwith charts and graphs of my feelings for you.\n[A graph shows romance and happiness. Romance cuts off, indicating a breakup before the meeting of Cueball and his current significant other, and happiness dips accordingly.\nA line indicates where the couple first met; romance is jagged thereafter, initially upwards but later down.\nHappiness climbs slightly more steadily and then dips again.\nMore lines indicate a period of dating and then one of engagement.]\nand the happiness you've brought me.But the more I analyzed\n[Cueball works at a computer.]\nr0 = 0.20\nr1 = -0.61\nr2 = -0.83\nthe harder it became to defend my hypothesis.In science, you can't publish results you know are wrong\nand you can't withhold them because they're not the ones you wanted.So I was left with a question: do I make graphs because they're cute and funny,\n[Cueball sits, looking at a sheet of paper.]\nor am I a scientist?Enclosed are my results.\nI hope you can find somebody else\n[A jagged, declining graph is superimposed over a red heart.]\nto be your valentine."
