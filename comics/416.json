The text written on the laptop is shown above him, and there is a zigzag line from the laptop to the bottom of the last sentence.]\nLaptop: Starting WiFi autoconfig... searching for WiFi... Found no open networks.\nLaptop: Found secure net SSID \"Lenhart Family\"[Same setup, but Cueball has changed position. This time there are two zigzag lines between the two sentences from the laptop.]\nLaptop: Trying common passwords... Failed. Checking for WEP Vulnerabilities...\nCueball: Um.\nLaptop: None found.[Cueball is still sitting with laptop in his lap, but his hand is on his chin. A phone on table across room starts vibrating. Again only one zigzag line to the bottom sentence.]\nLaptop: Connecting to Bluetooth phone... Calling local school... \nLaptop: Found Lenhart children.[Zoom back to Cueball, who is furiously typing on his laptop, legs stretched out.]\nLaptop: Notifying field agents. Children acquired. Calling Lenhart parents. Negotiating for WiFi password...\nCueball [typing] on laptop: Ctrl-C Ctrl-C"
