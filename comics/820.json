  "transcript": "Because of a family illness, instead of regular comics, this week I'll be sharing some strips that I drew as part of a game I played with friends.  Each comic had to be written and drawn in five minutes.--RandallComic #1\n[A ninja is hiding under a diving board as a man runs along it.][The man jumps on the end of the board and hits the ninja in the head, knocking him into the pool.][The ninja floats in the water. A bullet passes through the man's head.]\nthwipp[The man is lying bleeding on the diving board, the ninja is still unconscious on the pool.][A sniper is at the top of a hill. The sign in front of the hill says \"Grassy Knoll\".][Someone is pointing at the diagram of the previous panel.]\nOff-panel voice: Wait, so what does this have to do with 9/11, again?\nCueball: I said I'm getting there!Comic #2\n[Cueball is studying Megan.]\nCueball: You look different.Cueball: You have this... glow about you.[They stare in silence.][A baby falls out of Megan.]\nplopComic #3\nMegan: Cogito ergo cogito.\nOff-panel voice: Playing it safe, huh?Comic #4\n[Two children dressed up as ghosts are standing in front of Megan at a door, each carrying a bag.]\nChildren: Trick or treat![Megan doesn't move.]Child: Um hi. Why are you just standing there?\nOther Child: Candy?[Another silent panel as the children stare up at Megan.][The second child looks in their bag.]\nOther Child: Oh God, my bag of candy.Other Child: It's filling with blood.\nChild: We should go.Comic #5\n[A jet is flying across the panel.]\nPilot: Bail out!

AAAAAAAAAA!Comic #7\n[Two people are carrying lightsabers and wearing robes.]\nCueball: Oh God, my eyes won't focus right! And your robe looks... really dirty!\nMy blacklightsaber was not a success.Comic #8\n[Cueball is standing.]\nCueball: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...\nOff-screen voice: It seems we happen to be all ladies, actually.\nCueball: ...in that case, this defense is going to appear extremely ill-advised.Comic #9\n[Darth Vader is sitting between two people, at a table.]\nCueball: Your sad devotion to that ancient religion hasn't helped you conjur up the stolen data tapes, or given you—\nDarth Vader: HEY. Wicca is a legitimate belief system![Darth Vader is drawing a pentagram on the table.]\nCueball: What are you—\nDarth Vader: Putting a hex on your family."
