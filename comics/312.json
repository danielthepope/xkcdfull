  "transcript": "[A not-very-realistic view of the universe, in profile. To the left, a sectional view of the Earth, with its Moon and few clouds overhead, and a little Cueball standing, looking up. Extending to the right of the Earth, various stellar objects: some planets, some spaceships, another galaxy. Above them, on an artistically jagged white background, somewhat like a torn piece of paper, this text:]\nA God's Lament\n\nSome said the world should be in Perl;\nSome said in Lisp.\nNow, having given both a whirl,\nI held with those who favored Perl.\nBut I fear we passed to men\nA disappointing founding myth,\nAnd should we write it all again,\nI'd end it with\nA close-paren.\n\n[To the right of the \"various stellar objects\", as if paired with the Earth at their left to bracket them, is a giant close parenthesis:]\n)"
