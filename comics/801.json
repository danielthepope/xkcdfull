  "transcript": "[Black Hat is going through a door, a bottle in his hand. A voice speaks to him from off panel.]\nCueball: Seriously? This thing runs Java? It's single-purpose hardware![Cueball is sitting at a computer, holding some device which is wired to a box, and pointing at the screen.]\nCueball: I bet they actually hired someone to spend six months porting this JVM so they could write their 20 lines of code in a familiar setting.[Black Hat has a pair of bolt cutters in the hand that had been obscured in the first panel.]\nBlack Hat: Well, you know what they sayâ€” When all you have is a pair of bolt cutters and a bottle of vodka, everything looks like the lock on the door of Wolf Blitzer's boathouse.\nCueball: I'm glad you had a nice night."
