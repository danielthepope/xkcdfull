  "transcript": "[From left to right, Megan (sitting), Science Girl, White Hat, Ponytail, and Cueball are having a party. There are two machines on either side of the scene, moving the walls on the left and right ever-closer in. The machines have pistons which push the walls together, and their rods are more than long enough for the walls to meet in the middle and crush the group. Cueball and Megan are pressed up against the walls, trying to slow the advance. The other three characters appear anxious.][Caption below the panel:]\nI'm planning a trash-compactor-themed party for when this is all over so we can get used to standing near each other again. "
