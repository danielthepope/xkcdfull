The chain starts on the left with a mains plug (type B), followed by the first rectifier. It ends with the last inverter, and a female mains plug (type B socket).][They are also labelled, by means of the words \"rectifiers\" and \"inverters\" with arrows drawn pointing to a few of each. Per the labels, the inverters are the big chunky ones, and the rectifiers are the smaller ones.]Meta-alternating current extension cord\n(alternates between AC and DC)"
