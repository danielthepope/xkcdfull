Megan has thrown her arms in the air, and a star burst at her forehead where her speech line emanates, indicate she is agitated.]\nMegan: Ugh, everyone's an epidemiologist.\nMegan: It's like when there's a mountaineering disaster in the news, and suddenly everyone is an expert on mountain climbing safety.[In a frame-less panel they walk on together.]\nCueball: I mean, it's not exactly like that.\nCueball: If the entire world's population were suddenly stranded on mountaintops together, a lot of people would understandably be trying to become mountaineering experts really fast.\nMegan: Okay, that's fair.[Megan stops and lift both hands palm up while Cueball walks past her.]\nMegan: But I do wish they wouldn't keep going on TV and saying \"According to my research on gravity, if everyone curls into a ball and rolls, we'll get to the bottom quickly!\"\nCueball: Yes, that's definitely not helping."
