Behind the desk on the left is a sales clerk wearing a peaked cap and typing on a cash register.]\nSales clerk: That will be $23.03. \nSales clerk: Also, I'll pay you 24 cents for your last name, 35 cents for a list of your family members, 79 cents for your cell number, and $1.20 if you hand me your phone and let me scroll through your Facebook posts.
