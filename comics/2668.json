  "transcript": "[A vertical rocket is standing on four deployed legs on the surface of the Moon. The surface is depicted with characteristic craters and rocks with a slightly curved horizon. The rocket is standing in the left part of the panel. A short ladder leads down from a hatch in the lower part of the rocket body. An astronaut has stepped down from a ladder onto the Moon's surface, and is speaking:]Astronaut: This is one of my favorite historical quotes â€” the first words spoken by an Artemis astronaut on the Moon.[Caption beneath the panel:]\nNeil Armstrong's \"man\"/\"a man\" quote created a lot of historical confusion, and I think it's our duty to expand on that legacy with Artemis."
