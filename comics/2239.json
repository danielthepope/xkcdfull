  "transcript": "[Megan is talking to Black Hat.]\nMegan: I can't believe this data error invalidates a year and a half of my research.\nMegan: I was about to publish.[In a frame-less panel Black Hat replies while holding two fingers up one on either hand.]\nBlack Hat: Don't panic. You have two options.\nMegan: Yeah?[Closeup shot of Black Hat holding one hand out with the palm up.]\nBlack Hat: 1) Redo your analysis and share whatever results you can, whether positive or negative. It's disappointing, but these things happen.[Zoom out on Black Hat and Megan. Black Hat holds his closed fist up in front of him. Megan throws both arms up in the air.]\nBlack Hat: 2) Destroy the evidence. Use your materials and research methods to build a superweapon. Conquer Earth and rule with an iron fist.\nMegan: Tremble before my anomalously productive algae!\nMegan: Except the anomaly was an artifact.\nMegan: Tremble before my normal algae!"
