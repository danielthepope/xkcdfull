  "transcript": "[Cueball stands at a distance from Megan, who is wearing a face mask]\nCueball: Homemade mask, huh? You think they help?\nCueball: I've read so many conflicting things.[Flashback to when Megan was not wearing a mask but carrying a large sign, with Cueball and Ponytail approaching her from both sides. It is not possible to read what is on the sign. Masked Megan is pictured in an inset panel.]\nMegan (narrating): Well, what I was doing before was carrying around a big sign that said \"There's a pandemic so please give me space because I don't want to get sick or make anyone else sick!\"[Same as first panel]\nMegan: The problem was, I had to write small to fit, so people kept walking closer to read it.\nCueball: Oops.\nMegan: Yeah, the mask gets it across better."
