  "transcript": "[Three Cueball-like guys stand in front of a sketch. The middle Cueball is the protagonist of the comic and will be called Cueball.]\nLeft Cueball-like guy: Do you have any thoughts regarding the particle accelerator's tertiary F.E.L. Guidance System?\nCueball: We can't put the broken part in the machine. It wouldn't smash the right tiny things together. Then the machine might break.\nCueball: That would be very bad.[Caption below the frame:]\nI spent all night reading simple.wikipedia.org, and now I can't stop talking like this."
