Above him is the first line of text, and then he speaks the next line:]\nA message from sysadmins everywhere:\nBlack Hat: Seriously, don't screw with DNS.  If you break this internet, we are not making you a new one.[Below the black panel is a visible message from Randall written normally black on white in xkcd style.]\nI make my living drawing xkcd, which wouldn't have been possible if people \nhadn't been able to freely share my comics with each other all over the internet. \nAs a copyright holder and small business owner, I oppose SOPA and PIPA. \n[Randall Munroe's signature, with a little drawing of Cueball on one of the tails. Below that a last message.]\nRandall Munroe\nSee the links below to learn more."
