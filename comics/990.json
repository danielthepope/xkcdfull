  "transcript": "Fun Fact: Stores have a competition to see who can spread your items across the most plastic shopping bags.[5 items placed in a single bag; heaviest item placed at the bottom.]\nBag Packer: Here you go!\nShopper: Thanks![Same items; heaviest item now placed in separate bag.]\nBag Packer: Here you go!\nShopper: Oh, that's easier to carry.[Heavy item is now double bagged.]\nBag Packer: Here you go!\nShopper: Double-bagging the big stuff makes sense...[The other 4 items are now split into 2 separate bags.]\nBag Packer: Here you go!\nShopper: That's a bit wasteful...[The 2 separate bags are now double bagged.]\nBag Packer: Here you go!\nShopper: You just put five items in six bags.[Every item is now in its own, double-bagged bag.]\nBag Packer: Here you go!\nShopper: OK! I give up! I'll buy a reusable bag![Reusable bag is double-bagged.]\nBag Packer: Here you go!\nShopper: Augh!"
