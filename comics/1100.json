  "transcript": "[A bride in full wedding dress, that looks like Megan, and Cueball with a bow-tie as the groom stand next to each other. Each has a hand outstretched toward the other.]\nOfficiator (off panel): Do you take this man to be your lawful wedded husband?\nBride: ...No.[Cueball steps back in surprise. The bride removes a wig to reveal that she is in fact a Cueball-like man.]\nGroom: What? Amy!?\nMan: I'm not Amy. None of this was real. You're back in senior year. It's the big game.[Cueball puts his hands to his head in confusion. The man holds up an American football, still holding the wig in his other hand.]\nCueball: What is this!?\nMan: The greatest high school football misdirection play of all time.[Cueball puts his hands to his mouth as the man in the wedding dress begins to run backwards, away from him holding up the ball.][Cueball remains frozen in horror as the man turns and dashes toward the goalpost in the distance.]"
