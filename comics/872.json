  "transcript": "[Megan sits in an armchair, reading a book looking over her shoulder at Cueball as he walks in.]\nMegan: Are there eigenvectors in Cinderella?\nCueball: ...No?\nMegan: The prince didn't use them to match the shoe to its owner?\nCueball: What are you talking about?\nMegan: Dammit.[In this frame-less panel Megan is shown in a flashback as a little girl lying in bed, head on pillow and hands held on the edge of the blanket at her throat.
