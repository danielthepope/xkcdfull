  "transcript": "[Cueball is sitting in a car parked to the left of Hairy, who thus stands in front of it while pointing behind him towards a big black hole.]\nCueball: My engine's making a weird noise. Can you take a look?\nHairy: Sure, just pop the hood.\nCueball: Oh, the hood latch is also broken.\nHairy: OK, just pull up to that big pit and push the car in. We'll go get a new one.[Caption below the frame:]\nI'm sure the economics make sense, but it still freaks me out how quick companies are to replace computing devices instead of trying to fix them."
