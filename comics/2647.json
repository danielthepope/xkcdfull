  "transcript": "[Cueball, wearing a lab coat, is drinking out of a straw inserted into an IV drip bag that is labeled \"saline\" (on the 2x image; it is rendered unreadable on the standard resolution version, just like the rest of the label's squiggles). Cueball is surrounded by hospital staff. To the left is Megan with a white hat, she is holding a clipboard, with a paper with unreadable text. To his right is Dr. Ponytail holding a rolled up paper under one arm and, to the right of her, a man with a similar hat as Megan. They are all looking at Cueball.]\nCueball: You know, these Capri Suns are good, but they're really salty.[Caption below the panel:]\nI think the hospital may be starting to realize that I'm not actually a doctor."
