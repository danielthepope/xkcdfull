The title of this segment is shown below the feed.]\nHairy: All Hollywood is in town for tonight's star-studded premiere! We go live to our reporter on the red carpet. \nHairy: How do things look?\nTitle: Red Carpet Report[Megan switches to full-screen. Megan is standing in front of a full crowd of Cueball heads who are behind a line held up be sticks, one of which is visible behind her. She holds a large microphone up to her face.]\nMegan: Bleak. \nMegan: In 800 million years the aging, brightening Sun will boil away the oceans, and all this will be blowing sand.[Switch back to initial framing with Hairy moving his arms further away from himself and Megan now with the microphone visible.]\nHairy: Oh. Um. ...Sounds pretty grim. How are the stars reacting?\nMegan: Hydrogen fusion. But it won't last forever.\nHairy: I mean the movie stars.\nMegan: They won't last forever either. None of us will.\nTitle: Red Carpet Report"
