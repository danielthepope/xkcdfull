  "transcript": "[Science Girl and a girl with long curly hair, are standing under a large leafless tree as Science Girl adjusts a tire swing hanging from the largest of the branches of the tree. The tire hangs so high that the small girls only reach up to just above the center of the tire which has a diameter of more than half the height of the girls.]\nScience Girl: OK, looks good.[Zoom in on the girls so only the tire swing can be seen, and nothing of the tree. They both look at the tire.]\nScience Girl: I read that there are these huge dumps everywhere full of millions of old tires that no one knows what to do with.[Same setting but Science Girl looks up at the tree (outside the frame).]\nScience Girl: We should use one of those next time.\nCurly haired girl: Yeah. That guy was real mad.\nScience Girl: I would not want to fight him again."
