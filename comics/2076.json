  "transcript": "[White Hat and Cueball are walking, with Cueball holding his arms out in front of him.]\nWhite Hat: So you don't like any horror movies?\nCueball: Spooky stuff is neat but I hate jump scares and watching people get murdered.\nCueball: Why would you want to see that?[Zoom in on the two.]\nWhite Hat: It's like roller coasters. People like experiencing powerful feelings in a safe, controlled setting.\nCueball: But why not good feelings?[In a frame-less panel Cueball stops and turns towards White Hat.]\nWhite Hat: We've always been into tragic stories. Romeo and Juliet, Titanic...\nCueball: See, that's another thing I don't get![Zoom out again as White Hat walks past Cueball who now hold his arms out to the side as he looks after White Hat.]\nCueball: I loved Titanic because Rose and Jack found each other and seemed so happy! I just hated the ending.\nWhite Hat: I'll be sure to give James Cameron and Shakespeare your feedback."
