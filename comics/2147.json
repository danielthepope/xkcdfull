  "transcript": "[Cueball is seated on an medical examination table, clutching his stomach, while Ponytail stands dressed in a doctor's coat holding a file on a clipboard in her left hand.]\nPonytail: Well, we zapped you with energy beams, and it looks like one of your stupid organs is a traitor.\nCueball: ...which one?\nPonytail: I dunno, appendix? Gallbladder? One of the little ones that sucks.\nCueball: What should I do?[Closeup on Ponytail. She holds her left hand in a clenched fist.]\nPonytail: You could quash the revolt with the ruthless deployment of chemical and biological weapons.\nCueball (off-screen): ...antibiotics?\nPonytail: But certain victory comes only through the sword.\nCueball (off-screen): Surgery.[Closeup on Ponytail with her fists raised.]\nPonytail: While we're inside, we'll look around-if we see any signs of insurrection elsewhere, we will not hesitate to act. There can be no armistice. Your parts must fall in line or be crushed.\nCueball (off-screen): Um.[Zoom out again to the entire scene. Ponytail points her left hand up.]\nPonytail: When the battle is won, we will salt your abdomen so no new organs can ever sprout up to trouble you again.\nCueball: Maybe I should get a second opinion.\nPonytail: Only if you care what a weaker doctor would say."
