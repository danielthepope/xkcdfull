  "transcript": "[A man with a beard and a turban stands to the left of a crude wooden counter. On the right of the counter is a man with a beard and no turban. Both men are laughing. Further behind the counter is a woman with a bun kneeling on the ground and putting something into a box.]\nTurban man: Nine silvers for a ham? That's too much!\nNo-turban man: Too much? There's a monk out back with a ladder!Caption: There's no reason to think that people throughout history didn't have just as many inside jokes and catchphrases as any modern group of high-schoolers."
