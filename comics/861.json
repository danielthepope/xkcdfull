  "transcript": "Cueball, on phone: Hey! Know how you've been bugging me to play Minecraft for the past year? I'm game.\nMegan, on phone: But you said you didn't want to \"get hooked and spend days on end moving virtual cubes around while sitting motionless.\" What changed?Cueball, on phone: I'm having my wisdom teeth out, and I'll be useless and doped up on painkillers for the next few days, so that actually sounds like the perfect distraction.\nMegan, on phone: Oh. I'll set you up on our server!72 hours later...\n[Megan sitting at computer.]\nMegan, on phone: Hey â€” starting to feel better? Enjoying the game? Let's see what you've... What the hell? Where IS everything?[View of a Minecraft screen showing a vast empty expanse of land. In Cueball's hotbar is, from left to right, an stone pickaxe, sword, and shovel, seven feathers, 42 torches, a non-enchanted bow, a blank space, 64 blocks of stone and a clock.
