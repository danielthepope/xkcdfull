  "transcript": "[Cueball talks while walking up behind White Hat, who is reading in an armchair.]\nCueball: You know, in the universe where Biff Tannen took Marty McFly’s sports almanac back in time, the people wouldn’t have any counterfactuals to work with. \nCueball: Their world would be the world.[In a frame-less panel White Hat turns his head to look at Cueball as he keeps talking.]\nCueball: They would have spent decades debating which structural problems enabled the rise of BiffCo, the decline of the city, and general social decay. \nCueball: Everyone would find reasons it confirmed their pet theory.[White Hat turns his head back to his book.]\nCueball: I'm going to write a book set in that universe. I'll call it Hill Valley Elegy.\nWhite Hat: ... I hate you."
