  "alt": "After years of trying various methods, I broke this habit by pitting my impatience against my laziness. I decoupled the action and the neurological reward by setting up a simple 30-second delay I had to wait through, in which I couldn't do anything else, before any new page or chat client would load (and only allowed one to run at once). The urge to check all those sites magically vanished--and my 'productive' computer use was unaffected.",

  "transcript": "[Reddit page.]\nLuke (thinking): I shouldn't be looking at Reddit. Why can't I stop?[CNN page.]\nLuke (thinking): Refreshing CNN again. Do news stories so affect my life that I benefit from checking them more than once a day?[Shutdown screen.]\nLuke (thinking): I should at least check Faceb... no. Screw it. I can't do my job when I'm distracting myself every five minutes like this.[Two people looking at a battlefield screen.]\nCueball: His computer's off. Luke - You've switched off your targeting computer. What's wrong?\nLuke: Nothing. I'm all right."
