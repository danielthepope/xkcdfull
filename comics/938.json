  "transcript": "[Two people are standing facing each other, having a conversation. One is holding a laptop.]\nCueball (with laptop): What's the deal with this leukemia trial? {{Citation: Nejm, Aug 10, 2011}}\nFriend: Gotta wait and see.\nFriend: Helping the immune system attack tumors has been a longtime research target.\nFriend: Lots of promising leads. Often they don't pan out.Cueball: What'd these guys do?\nFriend: They took some of the patient's T-cells and patched their genes so they'd attack the cancer. That hasn't been enough in the past but their patch also added code to get the T-cells to replicate wildly and persist in the body.Cueball: Which worked, but created its own set of problems?\nFriend: How'd you guess? But I think the craziest part is the way they insert the patched genes.\nCueball: How?\nFriend: Well, think - What specializes in invading and modifying T-cells?\nCueball: Seriously?\nFriend: Yup. Must've been a fun conversation.[The last panel is set in a doctors office. A patient is sitting on the observation bed talking to their doctor.]\nPatient: Ok, so I have blood cells growing out of control, so you're going to give me different blood cells that also grow out of control?\nDoctor: Yes, but it's ok, because we've treated this blood with HIV!\nPatient: Are you sure you're a doctor?\nDoctor: Almost definitely."
