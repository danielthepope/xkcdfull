Ponytail is sitting to the left of the fire, with her body fully in the green habitable zone and is holding a stick with a marshmallow pointed at the fire. Cueball is sitting to the right of the fire, half sitting in the white area where the fire is and half in the green habitable zone. He is visibly sweating. Megan is crouching to the right of Cueball, outside the habitable zone with a marshmallow on a stick pointing into the green zone. Below the scene two arrows point to the two green areas marked with a label.]\nLabel: Habitable zone[Caption below panel:]\nAstronomers define the Campfire Habitable Zone as the region where you're far enough not to be burned but close enough to roast marshmallows."
