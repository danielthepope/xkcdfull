  "transcript": "[Megan is facing straight out of a slim panel as she stands behind a lectern addressing the reader.]\nMegan: An apple a day keeps the doctor away.\nMegan: Or at least, it used to.[The comic zooms out revealing that Megan and the lectern are standing on a podium. Megan is pointing behind her, with a stick, to at a poster prominently featuring Doctor Ponytail with three apples over her head.]\nMegan: Over time, some doctors have developed a resistance to apples. Keeping them away takes two or three apples instead of one.\nMegan: And there are worrying signs that a few doctors may have become completely immune.[The comic zooms in again on Megan behind the lectern.]\nMegan: So we must stockpile our finest apples in reserve, using them to fend off only the very worst doctors.\nMegan: Honeycrisps still work on most of them, but we don't know for how long."
