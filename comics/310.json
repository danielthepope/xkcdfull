The text is written above them in a frame with yellow background.]\nI understand now. There's no choir of angels when you meet the right person. It's about growing out of your fears to realize what you have is what you want.[Cueball and the woman are getting married. They stand under a gate of honor with a priest in front of them.]\nGirl: I do.\nCueball: I do.[Cueball walks hand in hand with blond girl when a cloud with trumpeting angels appears over Megan.]\nMegan: Hi.[Same picture but without the cloud and angels. Cueball's thought is written in a frame with yellow background.]\nWell, shit."
