  "transcript": "[A sign sits by a well.]\nThe Uncomfortable Truths Well[A Cueball-like guy and Ponytail are lined up for the well; the guy throws a coin in.]\nWell: For a universe that's supposed to be half Chinese, Firefly sure doesn't have any Asians.[The guy is gone, Cueball and Megsn arrives as a couple lining up behind Ponytail; Ponytail throws a coin in.]\nWell: There's no solid evidence DVORAK's better than QWERTY. The standard histories are urban legends.[Just the couple remain; Cueball throws another coin in.]\nWell: You've never said \"I love you\" and meant it. It was always just words.[Megan has presumably also thrown a coin in the well. This is not shown as for the first three. Cueball waits for her on the other side of the well.]\nWell: You meant it every time."
