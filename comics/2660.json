  "transcript": "[Six individuals in clothing representing early 1900s' American fashion stand in a line.  Four of them have speaking roles, from left to right, and two stand in silence, contributing to the feeling of a conversation amongst a crowd gathered around the first speaker]\nSpeaker 1 (white brim hat): Now, it may sound strange, but it's how Gen Z is doing things!\nSpeaker 2 (wavy hair, dress with belt): Gosh!  Is that really true??\nSpeaker 3 (dark hat with indent): Ridiculous.  It just goes to show what I've been saying about them.\nSpeaker 4 (hair in bun, dress with lace hem): Now now, maybe we just need to change with the times.[Caption below comic:] \nPeople ascribing qualities to \"Gen Z\" have the same energy as small-town salespeople in 1905 talking about what the ladies in Paris are up to."
