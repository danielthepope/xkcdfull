The clock on the wall says 12:50.]\nChapter 15: Special Relativity\nProblem 1:\nTwo spacecraft transmit messages to each other while passing at constant velocities of...\nCueball: sighMeanwhile:\n[Megan in a bubble and a spacecraft are moving towards each other. Each one has a velocity vector drawn before themselves, each showing a velocity of 0.2c.][They pass each other.]\nSpacecraft: We observe your speed to be 38.5%c, and your time is passing at 92.3% the rate of ours. Does this mirror your observations?\nMegan: Please help me. I think I'm lost.[They continue with the same velocity vectors. Megan is looking back at the spacecraft.]"
