  "transcript": "[Four views of the night sky are shown among each other. The text on top reads:]\nLight Pollution and the Disappearing Night Sky[The first view shows only a few bright stars visible on a fairly light gray-brownish background. The inline text on the left top is:]\nHigh Light Pollution\n(Cities)[On the second view more stars are visible and some faint blurry white clouds on a dark-gray background are visible.]\nModerate Light Pollution\n(Suburbs)[A lot of stars, even partly colored, and a clear image of many clouds on a dark background are shown.]\nLow Light Pollution\n(Very remote areas)[The last image shows the same region as above but with even more exposed stars and clouds, the colors are also more explicit. A faint lattice of triangles overlaying the image to its full extent and three ghastly silhouettes of sail-ships are shown embedded in clouds. The text on the top left reads:]\nNo Light Pollution\n(How the sky should look)\n[Four arrows are pointing to some triangles:]\nLattice of the crystal spheres\n[Three arrows are indicating the sail-ships:]\nShips of the Sky King"
