That must be killing big science journals, since they charge such huge subscription/publication fees.[Ponytail responds with her arms wide, palms up.]\nPonytail: Nah, we’ve been doing it since the 90s and nobody seems to care.[Megan contemplates, speechless.][Megan slightly raises her arms and Ponytail puts up a hand to shush her.]\nMegan: That makes no sense at all!!\nPonytail: Shhh, you’ll jinx it!"
