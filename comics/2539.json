He is talking to Megan, Hairy, and Ponytail who is looking at him.

There is a caption in a frame above her.]\nCaption: Physicist\nMegan: I won't flinch.\nMegan: I trust conservation of energy.[Zoom in on Hairy, in a wide panel. He has lifted arm holding his hand palm up toward Cueball (who is off-panel). There is a caption in a frame above him.]\nCaption: Biologist\nHairy: I trust my flinch reflex, which was honed by millions of years of evolution to protect my delicate face.
