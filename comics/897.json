Cueball standing next to the door reads the sign above the control panel.]\nCueball: It says here that the elevator inspection certificate is on file in the building office.\nFriend: Whoa, cool! Let's go look at it!\nPonytail: That sounds fun![Caption below the panel:]\nIndustry tip: Building owners know this never happens. Those signs mark elevators which have never been inspected."
