  "transcript": "[Cueball finds dorm room.][View into the dorm room. The left half is already occupied, and a roommate has filled his side with the normal accoutrements of dorm life. There is a Pink Floyd \"Dark Side of the Moon\" poster hanging on the far wall, offset and only on the roommate's side.][Cueball has a bit of a ponder.][Cueball leaves for a bit.][Cueball returns with an item.][View into the dorm room. Cueball is moving in, and has placed a second Pink Floyd \"Dark Side of the Moon\" poster modified with a lens in the rainbow's path. The poster is placed upside down on Cueball's side of the far wall to catch the rainbow, feed it back into the prism, and turn it back into a narrow stream of white light.]"
