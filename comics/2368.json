Can you help?[Cueball stands with both arms down while white Hat lift one hand up toward Cueball.]\nWhite Hat: It's obvious you don't actually care. If you did, you'd be trying to fix <bigger problem> instead.[Same setting as the first picture, wit Cueball's hand a bit further out towards White Hat.]\nCueball: Okay, want to help fix <bigger problem>?\nWhite Hat: No, for another reason I'll think of later."
