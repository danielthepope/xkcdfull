  "transcript": "[Cueball is diving in very deep, dark blue water. He shines a flashlight at the sea floor.]\nCueball (thinks): Eight meters. There's the wreckage... Yes! I see the key![As he swims further toward it, his flashlight starts to cut out.]\nCueball (thinks): Gotta grab it, surface, get in to the radio shed, and warn the President! Just a few more...\nFlashlight: BZZT FIZZ[This panel has no border like the others, and is divided in half diagonally by a thought bubble.]\n[The left half of it is a dark blue thought bubble with the diver inside it. On the right hand side are packaged flashlights hanging on a shelf. The one called Hi-Brite is $24.95 and is labeled \"water resistant to 10 meters.\" The one called \"FenStar G6\" is $49.95 and says \"water resistant to 40 meters.\"]\nCueball (thinks): Oh no.[Cueball and a friend stand in front of a flashlight display in a store. Cueball looks down at the packages with his hand on his chin in thought. The thought bubble from the previous panel leads from his head. The friend stands behind him.]\nCueball: ...maybe I should spring for the deeper water resistance.\nFriend: Why on earth would you care about that?\nCueball: Look, you never know."
