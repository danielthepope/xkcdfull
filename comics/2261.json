  "transcript": "[Ponytail is standing in front of a desk with a computer. One of her hands is on the keyboard. Behind her, Cueball, Hairy, and Megan are looking at the computer screen.]\nPonytail: We should upgrade.  What's the worst that could happen?\nCueball: Supervolcano.\nHairy: Robot uprising.\nMegan: Everyone falls down a well at once.[Zoom in on Cueball, Hairy, and Megan. Cueball has turned toward the other two.]\nCueball: Instead of hitting the tallest thing around, lightning starts hitting the nicest.\nMegan: Seagulls all get handguns.\nHairy: A really slow nuclear war.[Large panel with the original setting. Ponytail has turned towards the other three but is now facepalming, as Cueball gesturing with his hands at chest-height are still looking at the other two facing him.]\nCueball: We all have to go on a game show where they show you photos of people you've met once and ask you their names, and if you get one wrong a trapdoor opens and you fall into a garbage disposal.\nHairy: Ooh, that's a good one.\nMegan: Yeah, let's put off the upgrade."
