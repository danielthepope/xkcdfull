  "transcript": "[Cueball and Megan are at a security checkpoint in an airport. A guard is holding an open backpack and a bottle of water, and Cueball is arguing with him.]\nCueball: But if you're worried about bombs, why are you letting me keep my laptop batteries? If I overvolted them and breached the cells, it would make a sizeable explosion.\nMegan: Oh god.\nCueball: It's okay, dear. In a moment he'll realize I have a good point and return my water."
