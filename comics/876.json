I'm trapped!\nCueball: It's dark and I can't see anything except these two distorted splotches of light!\nCueball: Help![Ponytail, a 911 operator is in an office, wearing a headset.]\nPonytail: Splotches of light? Your... eyeballs?\nCueball (over phone): I think that's what they are! There's meat everywhere![Focus on Ponytail's head.]\nPonytail: ...so you're a brain.\nCueball (over phone): Yes!\nPonytail: Yeah, we all are. You're not trapped. Use your body to walk around and experience reality.Cueball: But everything's just signals in my sensory cortices! How can I be sure they correspond to an external world?!\nPonytail (over phone): I'm sorry, but we can't send a search-and-rescue team into Plato's cave."
