  "transcript": "[In a panel with light-gray background is a block of text:]\nAn investigator claims to have discovered in some dusty archives that back in the days when the Pilgrims landed each person coming to America from England was required to bring with them eight bushels of corn meal, two bushels of oatmeal, two gallons of vinegar and a gallon each of oil and brandy.In view of the fact that nothing of importance hinges on the truth or falsity of this statement, not much time need be consumed to ascertain whether this is truth or fiction.\nâ€”Kansas City Sun\nFriday, May 6th, 1921[Caption below the panel]\nI have a grudging respect for this 1921 newspaper fact-checker."
