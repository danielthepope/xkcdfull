A robot assassin has been sent here to kill you![Sarah holds her hands over her mouth. She has presumably dropped the tray, as it lies on the floor.]\nCueball: I'm here to save you. I may not be as strong or fast as a machine, but I'll fight to keep you-[There's a huge orange and yellow explosion. The two are disintegrated and Cueball's shotgun goes flying.]\nBOOM[A flying robot assassin is above the bomb site.]"
