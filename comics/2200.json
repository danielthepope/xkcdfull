There is an error message on the screen which is displayed above him with a zigzag line from the screen to the text. The exclamation mark at the top is shown in white on a black triangle.]\n! Error\nIf you're seeing this, the code is in what I thought was an unreachable state.\nI could give you advice for what to do. But honestly, why should you trust me? I clearly screwed this up. I'm writing a message that should never appear, yet I know it will probably appear someday.\nOn a deep level, I know I'm not up to this task. I'm so sorry.[Caption below the panel:]\nNever write error messages tired."
