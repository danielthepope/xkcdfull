  "transcript": "[Cueball stands behind a huge telephoto lens which rests on two tripods, one at the left in front of Cueball, and an other larger one in the middle. The lens is more than five times longer than Cueball is high. In front of the lens is a tree with a bird on top close to the lens. The bird is labeled \"Subject\". Inside the telephoto lens at the location of the objective lens a small device is shown and labeled \"Webcam\". From that device a small cable runs through the entire telephoto lens to the eyepiece, where an other device labeled \"Camera\" is shown.]\n[Caption below the panel:]\nTelephoto tip: If you add enough converters and extenders, you don't actually need a fancy lens."
