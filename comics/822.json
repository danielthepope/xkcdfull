  "transcript": "[A girl is sitting on a bench, reading a book. There is a tree. Far away, Cueball has a backpack on.]\nCueball's thought bubble: There she is. The most beautiful girl you've ever seen.[The focus is on the girl on the bench.]\nCueball's thought bubble: Every day you take this route to class, she's sitting on that bench, reading.[It goes even closer to her face.]\nCueball's thought bubble: You'd introduce yourself, but you wouldn't know what to say. Besides, she's way out of your league.[Back to the full panel.]\nCueball's thought bubble: What chance could an average guy like you have with such a radiant-\nGirl's thought bubble: Hey.[The girl looks up at her thought bubble with a question mark over her head.]\nCueball's thought bubble: E-Excuse me?\nGirl's thought bubble: I said hey.

So whiny!\nGirl's thought bubble: Seriously! I swear, he and Little Miss Daddy Issues over there were made for each other.[The two look at each other silently.]"
