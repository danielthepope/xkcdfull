  "transcript": "[Cueball walks in from the left, hand held up in front of him, to where Hairy is sitting in an armchair facing away, presumably feeling sick from a second COVID-19 vaccination. Hairy is wrapped in a blanket and holding a steaming mug, and his hair is messy.]\nCueball: I guess the first shot made your body build defenses, and now it's ramping up production.\nHairy: So I've become an antibody factory.[Cueball has walked around the chair and is now facing Hairy, whose mug continues to steam.]\nHairy: I don't feel great. I think my factory has some OSHA violations.\nHairy: My lymphatic system is protesting brutal working conditions.[In a frame-less panel, Cueball continues to stand in front of Hairy, whose mug is steaming less.]\nHairy: Update: my immune cells have unionized.\nCueball: Common side effect. Helps maintain a healthy balance.[In a panel with a frame, Cueball has raised a finger into the air, while Hairy is pointing in Cueball's direction. Hairy's mug is no longer steaming.]\nCueball: Immune system unions are actually why we stopped doing variolation.\nHairy: Oh? Why?\nCueball: They don't like scabs.\nHairy: Ugh. Leave. "
