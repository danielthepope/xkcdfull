  "transcript": "[Cueball sits before a computer on a desk while another man stands behind him.]\nMan: I was fascinated by locks as a kid. I loved how they turned information and patterns into physical strength.\nCueball: Why does my script keep dying?[Closeup on Cueball sitting at the computer.]\nMan: And a lock invites you to try and open it. It's the hacker instinct. Only your ignorance stands in the way.\nCueball: Wait it's passing bad strings.[Returns to the two shot of both men.]\nMan: I admired Harry Houdini, how he could open any lock and free himself from any restraint.\nCueball: Ah - Bash is parsing the spaces.Man: Sure some of it was fakery and showmanship. But I still wonder how he so consistently escaped handcuffs.\nCueball: Backslashes?\nMan: Huh?\nCueball: Never mind."
