  "transcript": "[Megan crawling on bed toward Cueball.]\nCueball: It's not something you can turn off.\n[Cueball pulling Megan, bedspread, and pillow off of bed onto floor.]\nCueball: A part of me is always detached. Abstracting, looking at numbers and patterns.\n[Megan on top of Cueball, both under bedspread, on floor. Megan looks to be 'touching' Cueball.]\nCueball: When we should be closest, part of me is still so alone. Counting the touches of her fingertips. Touch. Touch. Touch touch. Touch touch touch. Touch touch touch touch touch.\n[Same scene as third panel.]\nCueball: Wait. Is that... That's the Fibonacci sequence! Whatever I did to deserve you, it couldn't have been enough."
