  "transcript": "[Megan walks towards Cueball while looking at her phone. Cueball sits in front of his laptop.]\nMegan: Hey, you know that asteroid that tumbled past from another star system? It's apparently really long and skinny. \nMegan: Like a ratio of 6:1 or 10:1.\nCueball: Weird. Wonder what it's shaped like.[Megan lowers her phone and looks up. Cueball looks backward.]\nMegan: Without more data, it would be irresponsible to speculate further.\nCueball: So...you're going to?\nMegan: Absolutely.[Frameless panel focusing on Megan.]\nMegan: Here are some objects with a similar shape ratio:\nMegan: The 1:4:9 monolith from 2001: A Space Odyssey.\nMegan: A star destroyer.\nMegan: A huge eggplant emoji.[Same setting with Megan and Cueball.]\nMegan: A statue of Weird Al. An iPhone XXXXX. Voltron.\nMegan: A giant space coffin. But who could be inside? We can only guess. I'll start:\nCueball: This is all based on how many data points, again?\nMegan: One. But it's a perfect fit!"
