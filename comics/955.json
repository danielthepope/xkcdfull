  "transcript": "[Megan and Cueball are talking.]\nMegan: Did you see the neutrino speed of light thing?\nCueball: Yup! Good news; I need the cash.\nMegan: Huh? Cash?[Text above half-sized panel.]\nYeah. When there's a news story about a study overturning all of physics, I used to urge caution, remind people that experts aren't all stupid, and end up in pointless arguments about Galileo.[Half-height panel.]\n[Cueball sitting on chair, looking down at laptop in his lap. Books and things are on a desk in front of him.]\nCueball: No, this isn't about whether relativity exists. If it didn't, your GPS wouldn't work.\nCueball: What do you mean, \"science thought police\"? Have you seen our budget? We couldn't begin to afford our own thought police.[Megan and Cueball talking again.]\nMegan: That sounds miserable and unfulfilling.\nCueball: Yup. So I gave up, and now I just find excited believers and bet them $200 each that the new result won't pan out.[Same as last panel.]\nMegan: That's mean.\nCueball: It provides a good income, and if I'm ever wrong, I'll be too excited about the new physics to notice the loss."
