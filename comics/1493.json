Above this is his address to those in the meeting:]\nBeret Guy: Welcome to a meeting! I'm almost out of words, so I'll keep this short. Just wanna touch bases.\n[White text in the black sign (.website in grey):]\nCompanyName.website\nIf you're reading this, the web\nserver was installed correctly.™[Beret Guy stands in front of an office chair and a table talking.]\nBeret Guy: First, a few updates. We've learned from the state police that the self-driving car project we launched by accident during this morning's carpool has come to an end about 90 miles outside of town. Very exciting![Pony tail sits at the table.]\nBeret Guy [off-panel]: Profits are up. Sales, any luck figuring out who our customers are?\nPonytail: Nope. Money keeps appearing, but we have no idea how or why.\nBeret Guy [off-panel]: Great![Back to the situation from frame two.]\nBeret Guy: Oh, and one last thing—I saw a cool red beetle in the hall. Can someone add it to the bug tracker?\n[person off-panel]: Just did!\nBeret Guy: Thanks!"
