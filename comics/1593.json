  "transcript": "[Beret guy is sitting with headphones with a microphone on, looking out of the frame, hands resting on a table.]\nBeret Guy: For those just joining us, hi! We're on part 5 of a hitting game.[Zoom out with Beret guy shown from the side sitting at a desk.]\nBeret Guy: The next guy has a big bat, so he'll probably hit the ball real far.\nBeret Guy: Wait - he missed!\nBeret Guy: Oh good, they're letting him try again.[Zoom in again on Beret Guy still seen from the side.]\nBeret Guy: The people sitting on the chair shelves are yelling at this guy but he's ignoring them. Wow.\nBeret Guy: Rude.[Beret guy looks straight out.]\nBeret Guy: This thrower is good! He keeps making people leave by throwing balls at them.\nBeret Guy: It's just him, though. None of his teammates are joining in.[Beret guy turns his head to the side.]\nBeret Guy: That guy just ran to the second pillow when no one was looking!!\nBeret Guy: Everyone's real mad but I guess they checked the rules and there's nothing that says he can't do that.\nBeret Guy: Yikes. Hopefully they can fix that once this game is over."
