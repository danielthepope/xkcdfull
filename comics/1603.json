  "transcript": "[Cueball carries a flashlight walking towards Megan who is sitting on a couch.]\nCueball: Remember how flashlights sucked when we were kids? Always dim and finnicky?\nMegan: I guess?[Cueball and Megan walking to the left.]\nCueball: Well, I discovered there are now internet flashlight enthusiasts.\nCueball: And the technology has... improved.\nMegan: OK, Let's see.[It is dark outside where Cueball turns on the flashlight. The beam is very bright and very visible even seen from the side. Backscattered light reflects off Cueball and Megan's faces, turning them into bright white beings in the dark. The facade of the house and the stairs are also visible in the same manner, with deep dark shadows where anything is in the shadow. Megan averts her face from the light holds up a hand to cover her eyes. When the flashlight turns on it even makes a sound, written in white above the beam:]\nFlashlight: Fwoosh[Cueball and Megan look at what the beam falls on (outside the frame). Megan has taken her hand down. Both their faces are only lit up like a crescent moon. Cueball is holding the flashlight with both hands as if it is pushing back on him. The text is written in white on the dark sky above them.]\nCueball: See how it lights up the whole forest?\nMegan: ...The trees are on fire.\nCueball: Real bright, though."
