  "transcript": "[A color drawing of a ferret with airplane wings and tail on it.][Cueball and his Cueball-like friend (to the left) are talking.]\nFriend: Why on earth did you make those wings? You don't seriously think they could let your ferret fly, right?\nCueball: I... of course not.[They continue to talk.]\nCueball: That would be pretty dumb. It's just, uh... ...a Halloween costume.\nFriend: oh, okay.[They continue to talk. But now the head of the ferret can be seen to the far right on a table.]\nFriend: Besides, who would want a pet to fly anyway?\nCueball: Yeah. Pretty lame, huh?[The friend leaves the frame while Cueball stays. The ferret cannot be seen,]\nFriend: Anyway, let's go play video games.[Cueball stands behind after his friend has left. He looks back towards his Ferret which can be seen more clearly this time standing on the table.][Cueball imagines ferret flying over the ocean near the beach using his makeshift wings. The imagination is in color]"
