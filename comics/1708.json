A question comes from off-panel to the right. Above her a caption is written in a small frame that breaks the top of this panel's frame:]\nLater:\nMegan: Okay, I just read through every study I could find to try to figure out whether low-grade dehydration is even a real thing.\nOff-panel voice: What did you learn?[Megan looking downwards, has two starbursts a circles and two dots above her head signifying dizziness. Cueball stands to the right as another voice comes from off-panel to the right.]\nMegan: If you spend all day doing research and forget to eat or drink, you start to feel pretty bad.\nOff-panel voice: I'll get some water.\nMegan: But how many glas - Whoa, feeling dizzy.\nCueball: Maybe you should just drink straight from the tap."
