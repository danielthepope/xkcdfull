  "transcript": "COVID Precaution Level\n[Shown is a control knob for adjusting the stringency of precautions taken against COVID-19 (the knob has a black line indicating exactly where it is pointing), with fewer precautions to the left, more to the right. Most of the lower two thirds of the range is labelled \"precautions that feel insufficient\"; most of the upper two thirds is labelled \"precautions that feel excessive\".  There is an overlap between the two, covering about 1/4 of the range.  The control is set to somewhat above the top of the \"insufficient\" subrange.]"
