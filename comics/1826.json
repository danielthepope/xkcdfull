  "transcript": "[Cueball and his friend with a knit cap are standing together looking up in the sky. Cueball holds a camera with a large lens down in front of him, and his friend holds binoculars down in front of him.]\nCueball: Birdwatching is hard. \nCueball: They're all way too small and far away.[In a frame-less panel they both raise their tool eyepieces to their eyes.]\nCueball: That hawk is over a mile up! How did you even spot it?[Both lower their eyepiece again. The friend still looks up while Cueball looks down on his camera which he holds up in front of him. A black squiggly line above his head indicates that he is fuming over his camera's abilities.][Cueball now has a vacuum cleaner with a big body and a large hose which he is pointing towards the sky, as air is visibly sucked in to the hose and the vacuum cleaner is making a very loud noise which extends beyond the frame of the panel.Cueball is holding one hand on the vacuum cleaner which has a label with its brand on it. Cueball's camera lies on the ground in front of the vacuum cleaner. The friend looks back at Cueball.]\nVacuum cleaner: Whrrrrr\nLabel: Shop Vac"
