  "transcript": "[Cueball is sitting at his desk in an office chair pointing to his laptop while looking back over his shoulder talking to Megan off-panel.]\nCueball: Did you see this Boston Dynamics robot video? \nCueball: We're definitely all gonna die.[Megan walks in to the panel towards Cueball who still looks at her, but stops pointing.]\nMegan: You know, it's funny. \nMegan: Humans see a robot open a door, and we all instantly assume we're in mortal peril.[Zoom in on the heads of Megan and Cueball, both now looking at the off-panel screen.]\nMegan: So doesn't it make more sense to say the robots are all gonna die?\nCueball: Violently overreacting to a perceived threat? That doesn't sound like humans.\nMegan: Yeah, I must be thinking of some other species."
