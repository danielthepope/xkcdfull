The web is freaky, but it can't begin to have everything.\nCueball: There's no porn set atop storm-chasing vans. No homoerotic spelling bees. No women playing electric guitar in the shower.\nMegan: Actually, that last one would look pretty hot. As long as they were unplugged or waterproofed...\nMegan: Rivulets of water run down her chest, the smooth body of the guitar firm against her hips.\nMegan: She twangs the E-string and it shakes off tiny droplets in all directions.\n[She rises into a crouch.]\nMegan: You're sure it doesn't exist?\nCueball: Not yet.\nMegan: I'm registering WetRiffs.com.
