On the right side, a bar labeled 'Peak Energy' is shown, with colors starting from black, to green, to red, to green, to yellow, and to white from bottom to top. The center of the graph is a messy shape with ugly gradients from these colors.]\nCaption under the panel: Every year, disgruntled scientists compete for the Painbow Award for worst color scale."
