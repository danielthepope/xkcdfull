  "transcript": "[Cueball stands at a blackboard covered in equations and diagrams, an open laptop and scattered paper at his feet. His fists are balled in anger and there is a little angry squiggle over his head. A Cueball-like physicist stands behind him, arms out in a shrug.]\nPhysicist: You're trying to predict the behavior of <complicated system>? Just model it as a <simple object>, and then add some secondary terms to account for <complications I just thought of>.\nPhysicist: Easy, right?\nPhysicist: So, why does <your field> need a whole journal, anyway?[Caption below the panel:]\nLiberal-arts majors may be annoying sometimes, but there's nothing more obnoxious than a physicist first encountering a new subject."
