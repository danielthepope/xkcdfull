He is looking at a TV on the floor connected to a game console, also on the floor.]\nMegan: Can you pause for a moment and help me with something?\nCueball: You know, our love is like a katamari. We travel along, rolling up more and more of the world into our shared experience, taking it and making it our own.\nMegan: I, you... wow. Geekiness aside, that was actually incredibly sweet.\nCueball: The clutter of everyday life, with a simple core to tie it together, eventually becomes something grand as the world itself.\n[A rainbow extends outward from the TV, with \"ROYAL RAINBOW!\" above it. Cueball raises his hands in victory/exitement]\nMegan: Okay, also sweet, but now I'm wondering if you could possibly get any gayer."
