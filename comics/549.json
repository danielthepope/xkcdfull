There is a forest in the background]\nButtercup: Oh, my sweet Westley![Buttercup sits on her knees, Westley takes off his bandana.]\nButtercup: Why did you let me think you were dead?\nWestley: You shacked up with the prince!\nButtercup: After years of mourning! The worst pain of my life![Buttercup stands up looking down on Westley who still sits with the bandana in his hand.]\nButtercup: And now you ... kill people?\nWestley: I'd hardly be a dread pirate if I didn't.\nButtercup: How lovable.[Westley stands with the bandana in hand while Buttercup walks away from him.]Westley: It was for the sake of the narrative!\nButtercup: Fuck the narrative. I'm going to go see if that Spaniard's single.\nWestley: ...As you wish."
