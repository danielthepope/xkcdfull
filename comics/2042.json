  "alt": "I mean, if it's that easy to get a theorem named for you ... \"a straight line that passes through the center of a coplanar circle always divides the circle into two equal halves.\" Can I have that one? Wait, can I auction off the naming rights? It can be the Red Bull Theorem or the Quicken Loans Theorem, depending who wants it more.",

  "transcript": "[A single framed picture shows a colored x-y-graph with a text above:]\nRolle's Theorem\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaRolle's theorem states that any real, differentiable function that has the same value at two different points must have at least one \"stationary point\" between them where the slope is zero.[The graph shows a sine like curve in blue intersecting the x-axis at points \"a\" and \"b\" marked in red while in the middle a point \"c\" has a vertical dashed green line to the apex and on top also in green f'(c)=0 is drawn with a horizontal tangent line.][Caption below the frame:]\nEvery now and then, I feel like the math equivalent of the clueless art museum visitor squinting at a painting and saying \"c'mon, my kid could make that.\" "
