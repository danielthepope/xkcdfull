It has sections labelled \"bed\" and below has sections labeled \"night.\" They do not line up.]\n[Two men are talking together.]\nCueball: You have trouble sleeping right?\nFriend: Only when your mom is over.\n[Cueball is now pointing to a chart.]\nCueball: Since your work is flexible-\nFriend: -Like your mom-\nCueball: -you should try the 28-hour day - 20 awake, 8 asleep (or 19/9 if you prefer).\nFriend: I prefer your mom.\nCueball: It synchs up with the week - you spend weekdays awake normally, then on weekends you can go out all night.\nFriend: Just like your mom.\nCueball: It means four extra hours daily. You can stay up until you're exhausted every day and then spend a full 9 hours asleep each night!\nFriend: But how much time can I spend doing your mom?\nCueball: You? I'm guessing three or four minutes, tops.\nFriend: ...Well played."
