  "transcript": "[Cueball and Ponytail are facing each other, with wavy lines around them to indicate they are experiencing the shaking of an earthquake.]\nCueball: Earthquake!\nPonytail: We should get to a higher ground - There could be a tidal wave.[A frame-less panel with Cueball and Ponytail, with Cueball taking a pedantic pose and raising a finger.]\nCueball: You mean a tsunami. \"Tidal wave\" means a wave caused by tides.[A crash is heard, followed by Etymology-Man flying in while wearing a cape.]\nEtymology-man: You know, that doesn't add up.\nCueball and Ponytail: Etymology-man![Etymology-man takes a pedantic pose.]\nEtymology-man: What does \"tidal wave\" mean?
