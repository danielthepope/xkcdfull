  "transcript": "Where Citations Come From:\nCitogenesis Step #1\nThrough a convoluted process, a user's brain generates facts. These are typed into Wikipedia.\n[A guy with short hair sits at a desk, typing on a laptop.]\nGuy: (typing) The \"scroll lock\" key was was designed by future Energy Secretary Steven Chu in a college project.A rushed writer checks Wikipedia for a summary of their subject.\n[Ponytail sits at a desk, typing on a desktop.]\nPonytail: (typing) US Energy Secretary Steven Chu, (Nobel Prizewinner and creator of the ubiquitous \"scroll lock\" key) testified before Congress today...\nStep #2Surprised readers check Wikipedia, see the claim, and flag it for review. A passing editor finds the piece and adds it as a citation.\n[Cueball sits on a couch with a laptop in his lap, typing.]\nCueball: Google is your friend, people. (typing) <ref>{{cite web|url=\nStep #3Step #4\nNow that other writers have a real source, they repeat the fact.\n[A flow chart, with \"Wikipedia citation\" in the center. The word \"Wikipedia\" is in black, the word \"citations\" is white with a red background.\nA black arrow leads from \"brain\" to \"Wikipedia.\"\nA black arrow labeled \"words\" leads from \"Wikipedia\" to \"careless writers,\" and a red arrow labeled \"citations\" leads back to \"Wikipedia citations.\"\nA black & red arrow leads from \"Wikipedia\" to \"cited facts\" which leads to \"slightly more careful writers,\" which leads to \"more citations,\" which leads back toÂ :\"Wikipedia\" (all black & red arrows).]\nReferences proliferate, completing the citogenesis process."
