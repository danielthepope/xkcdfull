There is a clock that reads 2:53.]\nCueball: 253 is 11x23\nMan at computer: What?\nCueball: I'm factoring the time.[Zoomed in on Cueball, who explains himself.]\nCueball: I have nothing to do, so I'm trying to calculate the prime factors of the time each minute before it changes.\nCueball: It was easy when I started at 1:00, but with each hour the number gets bigger\nCueball: I wonder how long I can keep up.[Zoomed back out on the man, and Cueball. The man at the desk reaches back and touches the clock.]\nBEEP[Clock now reads 14:53.]\nCueball: Hey!\nMan at computer: Think fast."
