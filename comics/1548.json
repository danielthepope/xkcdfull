  "transcript": "[Two kids, with very different hair style, are in a playground. A fence is visible in the background, and on the ground appear to be various items including a puddle or rug and toy blocks.]\nScruffy-haired kid: Ugh don't you hate how parents are all \"Eat your carrots\" and \"LOL, remember Rugrats and Doug? Share if you're a 90's kid!\"\n[Caption below the panel:]\nThe median age at first birth in the US is 25, which means the typical new mother is now a 90's kid."
