  "transcript": "[Science Girl is standing in the front of a whiteboard holding a pointer up towards the board. Ponytail, Hairy, and Megan are sitting at desks facing Science Girl.]\nScience Girl: When everything is still, seismometers pick up faint tremors we call seismic noise.\nScience Girl: Most of it is from ocean waves, cars, etc.  But there's also a mysterious 26-second pulse.[Close up on Science Girl. She is holding a hand palm up towards the board behind her, showing a map with Africa in the center and some other continents at the edges of the view. A star is drawn within the country of Ghana, near the coastline.]\nScience Girl: We've triangulated the source to somewhere in the Gulf of Guinea.\nScience Girl: It comes and goes with the seasons, but it's been there since at least the 1980s.  It's so regular we use it to sync up seismometers.[In a frame-less panel only Science Girl is shown, once again in profile. She has the board behind her and points the pointer towards the board.]\nOff-panel voice: What causes it?\nScience Girl: Not sure.  The most popular theory is that storm-driven waves set up some kind of resonance with the coast.[Science Girl has leaned her stick on the board's tray.  She has raised her clenched fists.]\nScience Girl: Another theory is that long ago, seismologists murdered a giant and buried the body at sea.\nScience Girl: Now we are haunted by the beating of its telltale heart!\nScience Girl: Could be either.\nScience Girl: Further research is needed."
