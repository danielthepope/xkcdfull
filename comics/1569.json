  "transcript": "[Beret Guy and Megan stand next to a large pole with a note on it. Beret Guy points at the pole.]\nBeret Guy: Check it out! I threw my magic beans on the ground here yesterday, and this big tree appeared![Zoom out, the pole is revealed to have branches. Around the pole are trees about 1/9th of the height of the pole.]\nMegan: That's a cell tower.\nBeret Guy: No way - it has branches!\nBeret Guy: See?\nBeret Guy: I'm gonna climb it![Same as frame as the first. Beret Guy starts climbing the pole.]\nMegan: No, they just put those there to make it look-\nMegan: ...Never mind.[There is a caption in a small frame inlaid at the top of the last frame:]\nLater...\n[Megan looks at her phone while Beret Guy walks towards her holding an axe.]\nMegan: Why do I have no signal?\nBeret Guy: There were scary giants with yellow helmets in that tree! Luckily I cut it down before they ate me."
