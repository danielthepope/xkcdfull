Cueball is holding his camera down while Megan is holding her camera up taking a photo. As opposed to normal the text is written inside two speech bubbles with arrow ending pointing at the two. Also the sound of the camera is written inside a white area with small u shapes forming part of the frame for this sound.]\nCueball: Instead of driving all this way, we could've just taken our summer pictures and messed with the \"hue\" slider in Photoshop.\nMegan: Hush.\nCamera:  Click"
