  "transcript": "[Cueball is speaking while standing alone in a slim panel.]\nCueball: I worry about self-driving car safety features.[In a frame-less panel it turns out that Cueball is standing between  White Hat and Megan, holding his arms out towards each of them, while he continues to speak.]\nCueball: What's to stop someone from painting fake lines on the road, or dropping a cutout of a pedestrian onto a highway, to make cars swerve and crash? [Zoom in on Cueball's head as he continues to contemplate the situation holding a hand to his chin, while looking in White Hat's direction. Megan replies from off-panel behind him.]\nCueball: Except... those things would also work on human drivers. What's stopping people now? \nMegan (off-panel): Yeah, causing car crashes isn't hard.[Zoom back out to show all three of them again.]\nWhite Hat: I guess it's just that most people aren't murderers?\nCueball:  Oh, right. I always forget.\nMegan: An underappreciated component of our road safety system."
