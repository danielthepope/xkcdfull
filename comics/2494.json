  "transcript": "[Cueball is pointing a stick at a poster hanging behind him while addressing an unseen audience. There are two graphs on the poster with data points and fitting curves.]\nCueball: We realized all our data is flawed.[The three next panels all have a label in a frame going over the top of each panels frame. The poster can no longer be seen in the rest of the panels. Cueball has taken the stick down.]\nLabel: Good\nCueball: ...So we're not sure about our conclusions.[Cueball holds the pointer almost as in the first panel.]\nLabel: Bad\nCueball: ...So we did lots of math and then decided our data is actually fine.[Cueball holds the pointer so it point upwards. Also he lifts his other hand a bit up.]\nLabel: Very bad\nCueball: ...So we trained an AI to generate better data."
