So I tell Bret, and he's like \"She sounds just like my crazy ex.\" And I was like, \"dude, what was her name?\" and it was the same girl.\nGoatee Guy: I swear, if they made my life into a movie, no one would believe it.\nCueball: Yeah, though mostly because of the poorly-written dialogue and unlikeable main character."
