  "transcript": "[Cueball in a car, sitting at a red light.]\nCueball: This light always takes forever. I'd like to smack the idiot who designed this intersection.\n[An engineer steps up onto the hood of Cueball's car.]\nEngineer: Hi.\nCueball: Who the hell are you?\nEngineer: I designed this intersection.\nEngineer [arms spread outward]: You're right - I should have just made the light shorter! Never mind the hours of simulation and testing I did. Never mind that this intersection interacts with it's neighbors in a complicated way and it took me a week to work out timing sequences that avoided total jams.\nEngineer: Clearly, I'm a crappy engineer and you have a better solution. Go on, show me your proposed timings.\nCueball: Get the hell off my hood before I start driving and fling you into traffic.\nEngineer: You can't. Light's red.\nCueball: Well, when will it change?\nEngineer: Tuesday."
