  "transcript": "[Cueball sits on a toilet in a bathroom. The stall sidewall next to him is covered in graffiti: \"you suck,\" \"Mike sucks cock,\" \"CUNT,\" \"fuck,\" \"BITCHAS,\" \"dane was here\" struck through and \"dane is a fag\" written under it, a crude pictogram of a penis, and various other unreadable scribbles.]\n[One block of graffiti is salient:]\nThis graffiti is\nfleeting human contact\nboth of us lost,\nbut for a moment\nwe're lost together.\nI wonder who you are.I think I look for meaning in the wrong places sometimes."
