  "transcript": "[Megan and Cueball are showing a graph on a projected screen.  The graph is labeled \"Things\", with \"Time\" advancing to the right on the x-axis.  The level of \"Things\" has been rising over time to a point labeled \"Now\".  The current level of \"Things\" is above a level labeled \"Good\", and about as far below a level labeled \"Bad\".  Megan is pointing to the line of \"Things\" with a pointer stick, while Cueball is pointing up to the \"Bad\" level with a pointer stick.]Megan: Here's the situation:\nMegan: This line is here.\nCueball: But it's going up toward here.[White Hat enters the scene.  His hand is on his chin.  Cueball is no longer holding a pointer stick.]White Hat: So things will be bad?\nMegan: Unless someone does something to stop it.\nWhite Hat: Will anyone do that?\nMegan: ...We don't know.\nMegan: That's why we're showing you this.[A narrow panel focusing only on Megan and Cueball.]White Hat (off-panel, left): So you don't know,\nWhite Hat: And the graph says things are not bad.\nCueball: But if no one acts, they'll become bad.[White Hat is back inside the frame.  He is gesturing to Megan and Cueball with his palm up.]White Hat: Well, please let me know if that happens!\nMegan: Based on this conversation, it already has."
