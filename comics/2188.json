  "transcript": "[Cueball is getting off his e-scooter, with his bicycle helmet hanging on the handlebars. He has stopped right in front of White Hat who addresses him.]\nWhite Hat: Hey, you got one of those e-scooters!\nCueball: Yeah![Cueball is now standing next to the e-scooter holding on to the handlebars with one hand. Both he and White Hat look down at the scooter.]\nWhite Hat: So what do you think? I hear so much about these things.[A large panel with just White Hat who is spreading his arms out.]\nWhite Hat: Are they impractical and unsafe toys? Or a last-mile transit revolution?[Closeup on White Hat holding both arms out and up with palms held up.]\nWhite Hat: A low-carbon car replacement? Or Silicon Valley sidewalk clutter?[In a frame-less panel only Cueball and his e-scooter is shown.]\nCueball: Well, having given it lots of thought, here is my opinion on scooters:[Cueball is bending at the knees and holding on to the handlebars with both hands as White Hat is looking at him. Cueball starts making machine noises.]\nCueball: Zooooooom! \nCueball: Neeeeeoooormm \nCueball: Vrrrm Vrrmvrmm \nCueball: Wheeee![Cueball continues making sounds as in the previous panel. White Hat seems to have taken a step back.]\nCueball: Pew pew pew! \nCueball: Bzzzzt Kaboom!\nWhite Hat: Wait, why are there lasers?\nCueball: Pew!"
