We forgot to clean the ceiling![Black Hat has moved away from the bloody rags towards Danish who has taken her hands down. They look straight at each other. The bloody mop has fallen over on the floor.]\nDanish: There's no time!\nBlack Hat: Wait, I'll handle it.[Cueball with briefcase enters the house through the front door behind him, still standing open. He is greeted by Black Hat holding out a hand towards him. The corner of the room and the wall behind them and past the door is outlines with three lines connecting in the corner.]\nBlack Hat: Hi.
