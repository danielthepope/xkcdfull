  "transcript": "[Text above the first frame of the comic:]\nAugust 2013:\nThe International Astronomical Union \ndecides to start naming exoplanets,\nand—for the first time ever—asks for \nsuggestions from the general public.\nThey immediately regret this decision.\n[Ponytail is facepalming while Megan and Cueball are looking at a computer screen on a desk. Hairbun points to the screen.]\nCueball‏‎: Can't you filter out the worst ones?\nHairbun: This is after the filter![Below is a table showing the list of planet names as seen on the computer screen with gray background around the edges of the table.][The table is in two separate columns, but there is only headings over the left, so the right column is a direct continuation of the left. In the table it is mentioned when the right column begins. There is a small arrow pointing from the word \"Planet\" down to the second column of the table. The headings in the comic are not inside the table as they are here below. The text at the bottom of the left list seems to continue on below, at least the last entry is cut below the middle, although it is still easy to read. Similarly the text at the top right list, seems to continue from above, the top entry missing the very top of the text. This is as if the list is much longer and here is just shown part of the list. To further indicate this the first entry in the right list begins at \"c\" instead of at \"b\" which is else the case for all other instances.]\n\n Star \n Planet \n Suggested Name\n\n\nGliese 667\nb\nSpace Planet\n\n\nc\nPILF\n\n\nd\nA Star\n\n\ne\ne'); DROP TABLE PLANETS;--\n\n\nf\nBlogosphere\n\n\ng\nBlogodrome\n\n\nh\nEarth\n\n\nTau Ceti\nb\nSid Meier's Tau Ceti B\n\n\nc\nGiant Dog Planet\n\n\nd\nTiny Dog Planet\n\n\ne\nPhil Plainet\n\n\nf\nUnicode Snowman\n\n\nGliese 832\nb\nAsshole Jupiter\n\n\nGliese 581\nb\nWaist-deep Cats\n\n\nc\nPlanet #14\n\n\nd\nBallderaan\n\n\ne\nEternia Prime\n\n\nf\nTaupe Mars\n\n\ng\nJelly-Filled Planet\n\n\nEpsilon Eridani\nb\nSkydot\n\n\nc\nLaser Noises\n\n\nGliese 176\nb\nPandora\n\n\nc\nPantera\n\n\nKepler-61\nb\nGoldenPalace.com\n\n\n [Below is the right column.]\n\n\nUpsilon Andromidae\nc\nStampy\n\n\nd\nMoonchild\n\n\ne\nHam Sphere\n\n\nHD 20794\nb\nCosmic Sands\n\n\nc\nLegoland\n\n\nd\nPlanet with Arms\n\n\nHD 85512\nb\nLax Morality\n\n\nHD 40307\nb\nGood Planet\n\n\nc\nProblemland\n\n\nd\nSlickle\n\n\ne\nSpare Parts\n\n\nf\nNew Jersey VI\n\n\ng\nHow Do I Join the IAU\n\n\nGliese 163\nb\nNeil Tyson's Mustache\n\n\nc\n[email protected]\n\n\nd\nHair-Covered Planet\n\n\nPi Mensae\nb\nMoon Holder\n\n\nHD 189733\nb\nPermadeath\n\n\nKepler-22\nb\nBlue Ivy\n\n\nKepler-3284\nb\nBlainsley\n\n\nKepler-3255\nb\nUnicorn Thresher\n\n\nKepler-2418\nb\nSpherical Discworld\n\n\nKepler-1686\nb\nEmergency Backup Earth\n\n\nKepler-3010\nb\nFeeeoooooooop\n\n\nKepler-442\nb\nLiz\n"
