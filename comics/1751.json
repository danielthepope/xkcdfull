  "transcript": "[Black Hat is sitting in an armchair, with the right arm on the armrest and looking at his smartphone held in his left hand, when a voice from behind him (off-panel left) addresses him. It turns out in the next panels that it is Cueball.]\nCueball (off-panel): Your movie folder is so weird. Where do you find all this stuff?\nBlack Hat: Dunno.\nBlack Hat: Around.[In an frame-less panel Cueball is seen sitting in an office chair at a desk facing left. He is looking at Black Hat's computer while typing on the keyboard which is on a shelve lower than the regular desk surface. Black Hat replies to his queries from behind him off-panel right.]\nCueball: Lorem Ipsum: The Movie?\nCueball: Titanic XCVIII?\nBlack Hat (off-panel): That series gets good when they start hitting the reef created by all the previous wrecks.[Cueball leans in closer to the screen.]\nCueball: Debbie Did 9/11?\nCueball: Time Jam: A Connecticut Huskie on King Arthur's Court?\nBlack Hat (off-panel): Really underrated Space Jam sequel.[Zoom in on the scene so nothing beneath the keyboard is visible. The screen and Cueballs head almost spans the width of the panel.]\nCueball: Harold and Kumar Go to Howl's Moving Castle?\nCueball: A Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates?\nBlack Hat (off-panel): That's the original-the book was a novelization.[Back to Black Hat sitting in the chair as in the first panel, but leaning a bit further back and the arm on the armrest has been moved closer to him.]\nCueball (off-panel): Michael Bay's The Vagina Monologues!?\nBlack Hat: It's pretty good, despite all the CGI explosions."
