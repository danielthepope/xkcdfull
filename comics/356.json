  "transcript": "[Black Hat is sitting on a chair, Cueball is standing next to him. Across the street, another Cueball-like guy is coming from a building walking towards the zebra crossing across from Black Hat.]\nBlack Hat: There's a certain type of brain that's easily disabled. \nBlack Hat: If you show it an interesting problem, it involuntarily drops everything else to work on it.[The Cueball-like man across the street is about to enter a crosswalk, which is seen from right behind Black Hat in his chair, holding onto the sign, which is still pointing down. Cueball is looking on.]\nBlack Hat: This has led me to invent a new sport: Nerd Sniping. \nBlack Hat: See that physicist crossing the road?[Black Hat lifts up the sign when the physicist is in the middle of the street, halfway across the zebra crossing.]\nBlack Hat: Hey![A close-up of Black Hat's sign is shown in a frameless panel. There is text above and below an image of a four-by-five grid of nodes with resistors (shown as wiggly lines) between every node and also continuing away from the 16 outer nodes. A total of 5 columns with 5 and 4 rows with 6 resistors for a total of 20 nodes and 49 resistors. Two nodes, a knight's move apart, are marked with red circles in the 3rd row 2nd column and the 2nd row 4th column.]\nSign: On this infinite grid of ideal one-ohm resistors, \nSign: what's the equivalent resistance between the two marked nodes?[The Cueball-like physicist has stopped pondering the questions, a hand to his chin.]\nPhysicist: It's... Hmm. Interesting. Maybe if you start with... No, wait. Hmm... You couldâ€”[In another frameless panel, a ten-wheeled truck is zooming past from the right, apparently going through the spot where the physicist just stood.]\nTruck: Foooom[Cueball looks down on Black Hat, who looks back up from his chair at the curb, again holding the sign down. He lifts one hand up while replying.]\nCueball: I will have no part in this.\nBlack Hat: C'mon, make a sign. It's fun! Physicists are two points, mathematicians three."
