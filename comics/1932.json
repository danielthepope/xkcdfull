  "transcript": "[Cueball is talking to a guy wearing a Santa hat.]\nCueball: You’re looking festive.\nSanta Hat: I love Christmas!\nCueball: Really? Doesn’t seem like your kind of thing.\nSanta Hat: It’s our most meta holiday![Same setting.]\nCueball: How so?\nSanta Hat: All our Christmas stories now are about discovering the “true meaning of Christmas.”[The same setting in a frame-less panel where Santa Hat shrugs.]\nCueball: Huh, yeah. And then sharing it with others.\nSanta Hat: At some point, that quest itself became the true meaning.[Same setting with Santa Hat holding a hand to his chin.]\nCueball: Like a word whose definition is “the act of looking up the definition of this word.”\nSanta Hat: “Autometalogolex”?\nCueball: My least favorite of Santa’s reindeer."
