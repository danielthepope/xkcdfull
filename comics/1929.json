  "transcript": "[Shown is a curved time plot. There is a black line, marked \"Before Smartphones and Facebook\" and a red line marked \"After.\" On the y-axis the label reads \"Odds of getting in a friendship-ending argument.\" while there is no scale shown. On the x-axis, at uneven intervals some times of the day are marked as \"Wake up\", \"Get out of bed\", \"Breakfast\", \"Lunch\", \"Dinner\", \"Go to bed\", and \"Fall asleep.\"][With the exception of \"Waking up\" and \"Falling asleep\", the red line is slightly lower than the black line. Directly after \"Waking up\" and during the interval between \"Going to bed\" and \"Falling asleep\", the black line is near zero while the red line peaks.]"
