  "transcript": "[A giant praying mantis attacks a team of scientists, along with its legion of smaller-but-still-unusually-large mantises. Two of the scientists fight back, with a gun and a baseball bat respectively, while a third is in the mantis' clutches, held aloft by his foot, his goggles falling off his face. Bullets whiz by the giant mantis' head and a fourth scientist hides behind a desk, on which rests a microscope and an Erlenmeyer flask. A man in a cape approaches the hiding scientist.]\nEtymology-man: Ah, noâ€”you wanted ENTOmology-Man, spelled with an \"N\". See, it's from the Greek entomon, meaning \"insect,\" which is itself the neuter form of entomos, meaning \"segmented\" or...\nBLAM BLAM BLAM"
