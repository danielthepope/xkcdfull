  "transcript": "[Cueball and a friend approach a table.]\nCueball: Hey, what's up?\nFriend: Shhhhh.\nCueball: Hrm?\nFriend: There's a microSD card on your table.[A 16GB microSD card sits next to an assortment of coins for size reference.]\nCueball (out of panel): So?\nFriend (out of panel): I dunno, high storage densities freak me out. A whole aisle of library shelves on something smaller than a dime.[The two people stand near the table, the friend peering at the coins and card on the table.]\nFriend: Libraries are unnerving enough-millions of ideas surrounding you, towering over you. These cards fill me with that same reverence, that same intimidation.[Cueball stands alone.]\nFriend (out of panel): ...that same faint arousal. Maybe I'll just touch it.\nCueball: If you lose that card I'm NOT helping you find it."
