The front of the van is off-panel. Above them is a time and below that a description.]\n6:27 AM\nCrew departs for launch site\nLogo: NASA[A rocket launch pad with the rocket in the process of taking off, having lifted its exhaust to about a third of the height of the support tower. Smoke is billowing everywhere around the launch pad from the exhaust of the rocket. Above the rocket is a time and below that a description.]\n9:32 AM \nLiftoff[Caption beneath the panel:]\nI know I tend to arrive too early at the airport, but it still weirds me out that Neil Armstrong left for the launch site just three hours before departure.
