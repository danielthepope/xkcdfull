He gestures to an image of the globe with a giant crowbar inserted in the rift with an arrow indicating applying pressure to widen the rift.]\nBlack Hat: We don’t know why it stopped.  If elected, I vow to finish the job.  Thank you.[Ponytail, Black Hat, Megan, and Cueball walk to the right away from a set of stairs. Cueball is looking at a phone and Ponytail is looking at a device or paper with writing on it.]\nPonytail: Great job up there.\nBlack Hat: Thanks!  How are my polling numbers?\nPonytail: Well, I’m seeing some weakness in the Midwest.\nBlack Hat: So am I.  So am I."
