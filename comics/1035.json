  "transcript": "[Two Cadbury eggs, one in the foil, the other out of the foil and broken open to reveal the gooey center.]\nA Cadbury egg has about 20g of sugar. (25g outside the US.) \"One Cadbury Egg\" is a nice unit of sugar content.[A can of soda with an equals sign and two eggs; a bottle of soda with an equals sign and three eggs.]\nOne 12oz. can of soda has about two Cadbury eggs worth of sugar. One 20oz. bottle has three.[Two unwrapped Cadbury eggs, with an arrow indicating they should be placed in a glass of water.]\nOne Cadbury egg is enough to make me feel kinda gross. Now when I see Coke or Snapple or Nestea or whatever, I imagine drinking a couple of dissolved Cadbury eggs.[Megan puts her hand to her chin in thought, Cueball has his arms out in exclamation.]\nMegan: Wow. Huh. So the takeaway is... I can eat Cadbury eggs by the handful all season and feel no worse about it than I do about soda?\nCueball: That's not reallyâ€” \nMegan: This is awesome!\nCueball: *sigh*"
