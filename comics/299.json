  "transcript": "[Two men are talking. The second man is sitting on the ground, hugging his knees to his chest.]\nCueball: Maggie's gone. You can't bring her back.\nFriend: But I have to, she's a part of my life.\nCueball: *sigh*\nCueball: Okay, let me put this in your terms.\nCueball: Remember when Aeris died in FFVII? It was sad, but you had to keep playing.\nFriend: Actually, I downloaded a mod to add her back to my party. It changed other character's appearances and dialogue to hers so you didn't have to lose her.\nFriend: Lots of gamers did it.\n[Cueball puts his hand on his chin.]\nCueball: That is troubling on several levels.\nFriend: I wonder if Maggie's old dresses would fit you."
