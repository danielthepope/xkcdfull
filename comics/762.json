  "transcript": "[Megan stands by a TV set and addresses Cueball in the couch and his Cueball-like friend who sits in front of the TV on the floor.]\nMegan: While I'm up, does anyone want a sandwich?\nCueball: Is \"sandwich\" a metaphor?[A frame-less panel with the same scene, without the TV. Cueball has taken a hand to his chin and the friend on the floor looks down.]\nMegan: No, I'm bad at metaphors. But I could try a simile.\nCueball: I guess that's like a metaphor. \nCueball: Sure.[While Megan walks past them, Cueball leans forward and his friends looks back up at him as they continue to speak.]\nFriend: Well, \"a simile is like a metaphor\" is a simile.\nCueball: Is that simile itself a metaphor for something?\nFriend: Maybe it's a metaphor for analogy.[Cueball and his friend are still sitting and talking while Megan replies from off-panel.]\nCueball: Similes are like metaphors in that they're both analogies.\nMegan (off-panel): Analogies are like sandwiches in that I'm making one now."
