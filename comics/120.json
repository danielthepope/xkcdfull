  "transcript": "[A computer monitor displays the profile of a man named Randall on an online dating site. His profile contains a picture of a spiky-haired man and some text, which is rendered as dialogue in the panels.]\nRandall: Hi, my name is Randall. I like candlelight dinners and long walks on the beach.\nRandall: When I say long walks on the beach, I mean LONG walks on the beach. I've met people through these services who CLAIM to like long walks on the beach. But we'll be out there barely an hour before they start in with \"I'm tired\" and \"Don't you think it's time we head back?\" BRING A TENT."
