  "transcript": " [Cueball is inside a transparent human-sized sphere, evidently \"rolling\" forward. Ahead of him is White Hat, wearing a facemask.]\n Cueball: They laughed at me, all those years ago, when I got this human-sized hamster ball. [Frameless panel with just Cueball rolling forward, with his hand in a fist.]\n Cueball: But who's laughing now?!? [Cueball and White Hat have stopped. White Hat is pointing into the distance.]\n White Hat: Sounds like the same people.\n White Hat: See? There's some of them over there. [Cueball turns around to roll backwards while White Hat stands next to him still.]\n Cueball: Yeah, neighborhood kids.\n Cueball: At least they've stopped trying to roll me into soccer goals.\n Cueball: No, here they come.\n Cueball: Run!"
