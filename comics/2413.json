To the right of her head, a tape measure is spinning rapidly.]\nRetracting tape measure: zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz\nSpinning tape measure: SNAP\nPonytail: You know how when you retract a tape measure and let go, it leaves it spinning?\nPonytail: It's like that.\nCueball (off-panel): Oh, I see.[A tape measure with a laser instead of a measuring tape is spinning slowly.]\nCueball (off-panel): And if the tape measure is the kind with a laser level, that's the beam of radiation?\nPonytail (off-panel): Exactly![Cueball and Ponytail are walking next to each other in silhouette.]\nPonytail: And when the tape whips around and smacks your hand, that's the neutron degeneracy shockwave.\nCueball: Sounds painful!\nPonytail: Top cause of astronomer hand injuries."
