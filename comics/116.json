  "transcript": "[A picture of various apartment buildings.]\nShadowed city slumber silently. A second-story suite.\nCome craving courtship, selected serendipitously\nCrazed copulations, a salacious storm  of continuous coitus.\nSpread, straddled, conquered.\nCountless crashed suitors strewn carelessly.\nCenter, silken sheets sensuously caressing soft skin,\nContentedly sleeps your mom."
