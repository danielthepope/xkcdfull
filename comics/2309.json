Good clean syntax. Nothing weird.\nOffpanel voice: Okay...[Cueball holds the laptop at his side, and raises a finger on his other hand.]\nCueball: Except the only variable name is \"X\". To refer to different variables you have to write \"X\" in different fonts.\nOffpanel voice: I'm calling the court.\nAnother offpanel voice: Maybe we can appeal."
