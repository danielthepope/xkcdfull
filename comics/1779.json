So much of why 2016 was bad was because of the things it sent us into 2017 without.[Megan has hopped up onto the tree trunk and begins to walk along it]\nCueball: You gotta have hope, though.\nMegan: You say that, but you also said all this awful stuff couldn't happen, and it did. You're as clueless as the rest of us.[Cueball also walks along the tree trunk as Megan stops and turns to look at him]\nCueball: Well, if we're wrong about which bad things can happen, it's got to make us at least a little less sure about which good things can't.[Closeup of Megan hopping down from the tree]\nMegan: I guess.[A distant shot of Megan and Cueball walking along again]\nCueball: Plus, 2017 has a cool eclipse in it.\nMegan: Ooh, yeah!\nCueball: And it's prime.
