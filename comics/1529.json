  "transcript": "[A tournament bracket. With the names listed in groups on the left-hand side and right-hand side as shown below. Within individual groups the names are ordered in match-ups, two, three or even four in the first match. The last name on the right, Beyoncé, is not even matched for first round. The winners goes on to the next match, but there are many that skips some of the matches up until the quarterfinals, so some need to win 5 matches to reach the quarterfinals, others only need to win 4 of 3, and Beyoncé only 2. After the first level, the match-ups are always between two names. The two sides join up in a final in the middle, where the winner of the left side has a place for the name below and the winner of the right a place for the name above a central rectangular frame with place for the winners name. Below the pairing in the first round matches are mentioned above each of the clear groupings of the bracket.]\n\n\n[These are paired two and two.]\nLouis Armstrong\nNeil Armstrong\nLance Armstrong\nStretch Armstrong\n[These are paired two and two.]\nJeff Gordan\nJeff Bridges\nJeff Daniels\nJack Daniels\n[These are paired two and two.]\nOrson Welles\nH.G.
