  "transcript": "[Megan and Cueball are walking.]\nMegan: There's a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.\nCueball: Rainbows are circles. They have no end.\nMegan: Not quite![In a borderless panel, a multi-part graphic is shown depicting what Megan is describing off-panel: a short cone inside a longer cone, with the longer cone having its point starting at the Sun, the shorter cone having its point at a miniature Cueball's head, and both cones sharing the same circular base. The diagram is repeated from 3 different perspectives to make the structure easier to grasp.]\nMegan (off-panel): A rainbow is light leaving the Sun, bouncing off the clouds, and converging on your eye. It's an inside-out two-ended cone.[Megan and Cueball are still walking.]\nMegan: One end of that cone is your retina.[A wider view of the same scene, with Megan and Cueball walking on a dark ground.]\nMegan: The other end is the Sunâ€”which contains quintillions of tons of gold. There's more gold in the Sun than water in the oceans.\nCueball: So there is a pot of gold!\nCueball: What about leprechauns?\nMegan: All incinerated as the sun formed. Very sad."
