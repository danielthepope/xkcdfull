  "transcript": "When an earthquake hits, people flood the internet with posts about it-some within 20 or 30 seconds.\n[A room with a desk, chair, and computer are shaking. The person in it is on his phone, using Twitter.]\nRobM163 Huge earthquake here!Damaging seismic waves travel at 3-5km/s. Fiber signals move at ~200,000km/s.\n(minus network lag)This means when the seismic waves are about 100km out, they begin to be overtaken by the waves of posts ABOUT them.\n[There is a geographical border on a map; the front edge of the wave of the quake is shown, with the front edge of the wave of tweets surpassing it.]People outside this radius may get word of the quake via Twitter, IRC, or SMS before the shaking hits.\n[Megan and Cueball are standing, holding cell phones. Megan is looking at hers.]\nMegan: Whoa! Earthquake!Sadly, a Twitterer's first instinct is not to find shelter.\nMegan and Cueball (on phones): RT @RobM163 Huge earthquake here!"
