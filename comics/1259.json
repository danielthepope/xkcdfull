  "transcript": "[Beret Guy and Megan are walking through a wood.]\nMegan: There are these orchids whose flowers look like female bees. When males try to mate with them, they transfer pollen.[Megan kneels next to a flower.]\nMegan: This orchid - Ophrys Apifera - makes flowers, but no bees land on them because the bee it mimics went extinct long ago.[Megan stands.]\nMegan: Without its partner, the orchid has resorted to self-pollinating, a last-ditch genetic strategy that only delays the inevitable. Nothing of the bee remains, but we know it existed from the shape of this flower.[They walk on past the flower.]\nMegan: It's an idea of what the female bee looked like to the male bee...\nMegan: ...as interpreted by a plant.\nBeret Guy: Wow, so...[We see a full-colour painting of an orchid flower. It has purple-pink petals on a mottled grey background, along with the bee-like parts. It's quite a realistic painting.]\n...the only memory of the bee is a painting by a dying flower.[The flower is alone in a panel.][Beret Guy walks back on screen.][Beret Guy kneels down next to it.]\nBeret Guy: I'll remember your bee, orchid. I'll remember you.[Beret Guy walks off-panel again.]"
