  "transcript": "[Megan is setting up a party. She is standing with a bottle in one hand looking at a snack table in front of her. Beret Guy stands behind her with both arms raised. Above and behind them there is a big banner with gray text.]\nMegan: Everything's ready...\nMegan: Except we're out of ice.\nBeret Guy: I'll get some!\nBanner: Party![Beret Guy is walking down the street past a building with a store window and sign. He is waring a large bag of ice over his shoulder. Danish is standing on the sidewalk up against the brick wall and calls to him.]\nDanish: Hey sexy. Where're you headed with all that ice?\nBeret Guy: A party!\nDanish: There's a better party up at my place.\nBeret Guy: But I—\nDanish: C'mon, one drink.\nSign: Save Mart\nBag: Ice[Zoom in on Beret Guy who rubs his eyes groggily, small bubbles floating up from his head. A caption is written above the image in a box that breaks the top frame of this panel:]\nThe next morning...\nBeret Guy: ...Ugh... Where am I?\nBeret Guy: I was supposed to—\nBeret Guy: —Where's all my ice!?[Beret Guy looks down to find himself in a bathtub full of kidneys.
