Black lines for headings, several lines for paragraphs of text and white rectangles indicating figures are used to make each paper look different. Titles are as follows:]\nWe put a camera somewhere new\nHey, I found a trove of old records! They don't turn out to be particularly useful, but still, cool!\nMy colleague is wrong and I can finally prove it\nThe immune system is at it again\nWe figured out how to make this exotic material, so email us if you need some\nWhat are fish even doing down there\nThis task I had to do anyway turned out to be hard enough for its own paper\nHey, at least we showed that this method can produce results!
