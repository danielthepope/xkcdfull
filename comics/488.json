You can take it anywhere and it will always work.\n[There is a flowchart whose paths are (You're a Criminal)<-Pirate<-(Buy or Pirate)->Buy->(Things Change)->(You Try to Recover Your Collection)->(You're a Criminal)]\nBlack Hat: But if you buy DRM-locked media, and you ever switch operating systems or new technology comes along, your collection could be lost.\nBlack Hat: And if you try to keep it, you'll be a criminal (DMCA 1201).\nBlack Hat: So remember: if you want a collection you can count on, PIRATE IT.\nBlack Hat: Hey, you'll be a criminal either way.\n(If you don't like this, demand DRM-free files)"
