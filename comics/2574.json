  "transcript": "[Cueball and White Hat are talking to each other while Cueball is typing on his smartphone. A dark haired figure stands behind White Hat, drawn with thicker/rougher lines as if clad in bulky clothing, wearing spiky knee and elbow guards, a spike-embossed and notably scarred crash-helmet upon its head and a holding a glintingly sharp sword in its hand.]\nCueball: Ready to go?\nWhite Hat: Yup! Can you email me the tickets before we leave?\nCueball: Sure, one sec.[The next panel is nested inside the first, although at first it just looks like two individual panels. This could indicate the second panel is an immediate response to the first. The armored figure aggressively moves forward towards Cueball, who drops his phone in surprise. The armored figure has its sword-arm raised, the other hand pushing White Hat behind it, by pushing him in the face which causes him to stumble backwards so his hat starts to fall off.] \nCueball: Okay, I sent it to-\nArmored figure: It is outside work hours!\nArmored figure: Prepare to die!\nCueball: Augh![Caption below the panel:]\nI always feel bad when I trigger my friends' work autoresponders."
