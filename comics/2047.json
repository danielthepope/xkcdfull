  "transcript": "[Inside a single frame, liquid pouring out of a glass through mouth, the esophagus, and to the stomach is shown. However the surrounding bodies like the organs or the glass are not pictured, are only defined by the shape of the liquid, and must be imagined. Further two small parts within or near the invisible stomach with no visible connection to the rest are also wetted.]\n[Caption below the frame:]\nIt freaks me out to imagine what a beverage is shaped like when Iâ€™m in the middle of drinking it."
