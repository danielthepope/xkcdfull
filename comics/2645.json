  "transcript": "[Each panel features an image of space, with text printed in white at the top of each panel. The first panel only shows white dots representing stars, but with not much details to any of them. The text:]\nThey say the best camera is the one you have with you.[The second panel shows more stars and now some galaxies are clearly visible with galaxy shapes. There is also one very bright star in the lower part. The text:]\nIt turns out [The third panel is showing even more stars and galaxies with even more details to the galaxies, especially one large spiral galaxy in the upper right part. At the center of the panel is an outline drawing in white of the James Webb Space Telescope, seen from above the sun-shield so the telescope's hexagonal mirror segments and the arm in front of it are clearly visible. Also the shield's layers are drawn. The text:]\nThey're wrong."
