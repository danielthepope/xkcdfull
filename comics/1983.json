The x- and y-axes are labeled \"time\" and \"amount of stuff in my house\" respectively.]\n[The y-value generally increases straight-line as x increases. There are a few labeled exceptions where the y-value decreases slightly but instantly increases again. From left to right:]\n\"I need to clean up.\"\n\"I've really let junk build up. Feels good to clear it out.\"\n\"I hate moving, but at least it's a chance to finally get rid of all this excess stuff.\"\n\"Ah, spring cleaning!\"[Caption below the panel:]\nI'm starting to worry about my strategy for dealing with clutter."
