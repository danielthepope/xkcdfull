The drawing now sort of resembles a tent being blown over in the wind.]\nSteady as she goes...[The fourth line goes down and to the right, creating an approximately 47-degree angle with the last line, and our star is beginning to look a bit askew.]\n...uh oh.Shitshitshit[The fifth line comes up at a 48-degree angle, completely missing the first point by a mile, and our star has failed spectacularly.]\nABORT!\nABORT!"
