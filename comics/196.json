  "transcript": "[Two men talking.]\nCueball: Last night I was watching videos with this girl and my monitors kept turning off - even though I had disabled power save.\nFriend: Odd.\nCueball: However! I wrote a command to jiggle the mouse pointer every couple minutes to keep it from going idle.\nFriend: Not the first hack I'd try, but see?
