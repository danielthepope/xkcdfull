Cueball turns on the Tesla Coil and it sparks white static electricity.]\nclick\nBlack Hat: Cool, butâ€”[Lightning shoots out of Black Hat's hands, Cueball appears to be in shock  and awe.]\nBlack Hat: Check this out![The lights are back on, Cueball's arms are raised in amazement.]\nCueball: How did you do that?\nBlack Hat: The world doesn't actually make any sense. Science doesn't work. No one told you because you're so cute when you get into something.[Black Hat floats up the frame, and Cueball is pointing towards Black Hat.]\nBlack Hat: Still, neat toy.\nCueball: Now you're hovering!\nBlack Hat: I guess you're still not getting this."
