  "transcript": "[Cueball stands on the left while Beret Guy walks in from the right, carrying a smartphone.]\nBeret Guy: My phone's about to die.[The phone is now subtly larger.]\nCueball: Where'd you get a big iPhone? I didn't think they were out yet.\nBeret Guy: It's my regular one. It's just dying.[The phone increases in size again. Beret Guy now holds it in both hands.]\nBeret Guy: As it consumes its battery, it heats up and expands.\nBeret Guy: Soon it will swell to enormous size, engulfing us both.[The phone is now in the size of Beret Guy's torso; he is clutching it to himself. Cueball is pointing off-panel.]\nBeret Guy: Then it will collapse in a violent explosion!\nCueball: ...do you want to borrow my charger?\nBeret Guy: That would only make it run out faster!"
