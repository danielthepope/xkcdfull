His friend is holding a cell phone.]\nCueball (HDTV Owner): Check out my new HDTV-a beautiful, high-def 1080p.\nFriend: Wow, that's over TWICE the horizontal resolution of my cell phone.\nFriend: In fact, it almost beats the LCD monitor I got in 2004.\nIt baffles me that people find HDTV impressive."
