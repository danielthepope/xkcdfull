A voice calls out from behind her (at the right of the panel):]\nOff-panel voice: Help!\nOff-panel voice: I fell down a hole![Ponytail runs to the right, toward the hole.][Ponytail, kneeling down next to the hole, calls out:]\nPonytail: Hey!\nPonytail: Is \"fell down a hole\" exactly equivalent to \"fell in a hole,\" in your usage? Or do they have slightly different implications?[Caption below the panel]\nThere's a myth that linguists are pedants who love correcting people, but they're actually just enthusiastic about understanding language in all its infinite varieties, which is much worse."
