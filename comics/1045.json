  "transcript": "[Cueball sits in an office chair at his computer desk, motioning toward the screen with a hand as Megan stands behind him.]\nCueball: I don't get why authors and comedians spend so much energy trying to be clever on Twitter. Couldn't they put that creativity into more books and scripts? \nCueball: Is there something they like about the 140-character format?[Same picture but in a frame-less panel, except Cueball has taken his arm down.]\nMegan: Yeah. Writers working under tight restrictions produce novel materialâ€”like, for example, epigrams employing backward alphabetization.[A slim panel with only Cueball at his computer desk shown.]\nCueball: ...Whoa."
