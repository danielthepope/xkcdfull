I'd feel good about myself and my work every single day.\n[Cut back to the two girls.]\nMegan: I'd get to be the girl in the tower, only I'd be the one rescuing people.\nMegan: Why, what do you want to do?\nBlondie: I'm going to grad school. I don't really know why.\nMegan: Wanna come hang in my lighthouse over breaks?\nBlondie: ...yeah."
