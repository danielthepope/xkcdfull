He looks back up over his shoulder at Hairy.]\nHairy: Yeah, wellâ€”\nBlack Hat: Glue can't speak.\nBlack Hat: You try to scream, but your mouth fills with glue.\nBlack Hat: Your face is glue. Your body is glue.[Black Hat has left the book on the ground behind him and has risen. Hairy and Cueball is now together to the right and Black Hat advances towards them arms stretched out. Hairy steps backwards away from him.]\nBlack Hat: I wrap my rubber arms around your sticky bulk.\nBlack Hat: Your neoprene base bonds instantly with my surface.\nBlack Hat: Never to let go.[Zoom in on Black Hat's head. He is holding his arms up in front of him clapping them together. Hairy shouts from off panel.]\nBlack Hat: You are glue. I am rubber.\nBlack Hat: Staring at you with my dead, rubber eyes-\nBlack Hat: Forever.\nHairy (off-panel): Moooom!"
