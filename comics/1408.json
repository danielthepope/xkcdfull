She sits back from the laptop taking her hands down on her legs. Black Hat replies from off-panel.]\nMegan: OK, I get it. We're all aging.\nBlack Hat (off-panel): What? No.[Black Hat is in the frame again holding one hand slightly out towards Megan who has turned around in her office chair and is now facing Black Hat.]\nBlack Hat: I'm not trying to make you feel old. They were alive last night. \nBlack Hat:I'm trying to apologize.\nMegan: Oh God"
