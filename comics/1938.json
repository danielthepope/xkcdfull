  "transcript": "[Zoom out with Cueball and Ponytail walking to the right on the ground.]\nCueball: The Meltdown and Spectre exploits use \"speculative execution?\" What's that?\nPonytail: You know the trolley problem?

Then the unneeded \"phantom\" trolley disappears.[Zoom in on only Ponytail who has turned towards Cueball off-panel left.]\nPonytail: The phantom trolley isn't supposed to touch anyone. But it turns out you can still use it to do stuff.\nPonytail: And it can drive through walls.[Cueball and Ponytail, lifting both her palms up, are standing, facing each other.]\nCueball: That sounds bad.\nPonytail: Honestly, I've been assuming we were doomed ever since I learned about Rowhammer.[In a frame-less panel they continue talking, both with their arms down.]\nCueball: What's that?\nPonytail: If you toggle a row of memory cells on and off really fast, you can use electrical interference to flip nearby bits andâ€”\nCueball: Do we just suck at...computers?\nPonytail: Yup.
