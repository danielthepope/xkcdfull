There is another large jar farther back on the counter with a lid, with a small handle, on. In both jars there is a substance, which do stay in the same position in the jar even though Cueball tilts the jar he is holding.]\nCueball: My sourdough starter is coming along nicely![Caption below the panel]\nTheory: The coronavirus is a yeast symbiont with an extremely convoluted parasitic life cycle."
