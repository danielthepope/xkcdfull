Beat panel.][Same type of image of Megan, who cuts Blondie's reply (from off-panel) off in mid-sentence.]\nBlondie (off-panel): Do you-\nMegan: I want to be a storm chaser.[A black tornado reaches from the black storm clouds to the earth, kicking up a sizable cloud of debris at its base. Blondie is at the wheel of a car, with Megan hanging out the window and holding a camera.]"
