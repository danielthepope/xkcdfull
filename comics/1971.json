  "transcript": "[Cueball is talking to Ponytail and White Hat. Both of them are looking at Cueball.]\nCueball: Everyone keeps talking about \"personal data.\" To be honest, I don't really know what it is.  \nCueball: I mean, I understand the idea and know it's a thing I should protect. But it's so... abstract.[Close-up on Ponytail.]\nPonytail: Yeah.\nPonytail: It's like \"the economy.\" I don't really know what the economy is, if we're getting specific. I know stocks going up is good. For people who own stocks, at least.\nPonytail: Whatever \"stocks\" are.[White Hat responds with his arms slightly out and palms open. Both Ponytail and Cueball are looking at him.]\nWhite Hat: Yeah, or taxes. Everyone talks about taxes. What are they? Do I have to pay them? And to who?\nCueball: OK, wait, you definitely need to learn about that one.\nPonytail: Yeah, ideally sometime in the next few weeks."
