  "transcript": "Mathematically Annoying Advertising:A ∪ B = {x:x ≤ 15 or x > 15} = ℝ\n[line graph representing the above equation.]\nWhen discussing real numbers, it is impossible to get more vague than \"up to 15% or more\".[\"FREE!*\" in large text, with substantial illegible fine print.]\nIf someone has paid $x to have the word \"free\" typeset for you and N other people to read, their expected value for the money that will move from you to them is at least $(x / (N+1))[Graph representing inverse relationship between \"amount you spend\" on the y axis and \"amount you save\" on the x axis.]\nIt would be difficult for the phrase \"the more you spend the more you save\" to be more wrong."
