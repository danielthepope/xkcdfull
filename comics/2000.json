  "transcript": "[The comic depicts a smartphone showing many uncommon features. The front view shows a mouse cursor and a circle in the middle. The side view reveals the circle as something like an old photo lens from 1900 extending far above the surface and four large buttons (camera lenses) at the rear. The third view is from the top and just mentions a \"hollow ground.\" The bottom view looks like as it was opened by a can opener and shows a big USB connector and on the right a small black connection.]\nDockless\nSilent\nQuad camera takes four copies of every picture\nFront-facing camera obscura\n3D facial contour analysis shows you a realistic preview of your death mask\nSponsored pixels\nFront and rear pop-out grips\nHumidity-controlled crisper\nAntikythera mechanism\nNew York Times partnership: all photos taken with camera app are captioned in real time by reporter Maggie Haberman\nSpit valve\nStandard USB connector\nCoin purse-style squeeze access\nHollow-ground\nAbsorbent\nKeyboard supports dynamic typing\nBackflow preventer\nSwiss Army partnership: folding knife (unlocks only if Switzerland is invaded)\n100% BPA-free PCB construction\nAMOLCD display (7-segment)\nRuns on battery for the first 6 hours, then uses gasoline\nSharpie® dual stylus (dry-erase + permanent)\nMouse cursorIntroducing\nThe xkcd Phone 2000\nWe're still hoping this sounds like a futuristic number®®™®©™®"
