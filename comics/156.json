  "transcript": "[Cueball calls out to and Black Hat while they are some distance apart as seen from the side. Black Hat is holding an arm out towards Cueball making a gesture and speaking one word.]\nCueball: Hey, can you do me a favor?\nBlack Hat: Commented![The same setting seen from behind Black Hat with Cueball drawn much smaller in the background.]\nCueball: Huh?[Black Hat's hand is shown in close up. He is holding his first and second fingers parallel and at an angle towards the \"small\" Cueball to the left of the hand. The two fingers, as well as Cueball and his next line, are green.]\nCueball: Wait, what does that gesture even mean?"
