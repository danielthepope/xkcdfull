Waves of stink are rising from it.]\nCueball: Oh God, how old is this yogurt in your fridge?\n[Someone speaks from off-panel.]\nPerson: What's the expiration date?[Cueball holds up the cup to look at the bottom.]\nCueball: May 12th, but there's no year.\n[From off-panel again.]\nPerson: It's May 7th. So it's fine.[Now the second person is on panel, and Cueball speaks from off-panel. The second person is sitting down working on a laptop.]\nCueball: I'm not sure. When it was packaged, was civilization using the Gregorian or Julian calendar?\nPerson: Okay, I'll throw it out.\nCueball: No, it might still be good!"
