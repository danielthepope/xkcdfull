  "transcript": "[Megan and Beret Guy are walking through a landscape with spread out trees and grass and puddles on the ground.]\nMegan: Wow, this is all yours?\nBeret Guy: Yeah! All the way back to the river!\nBeret Guy: I walk here every day.[Megan still walks towards Beret Guy who has now stopped and is looking up while speaking to a man hanging in a tree in front of them. The man has long wild hair and a large beard. He hangs from his parachute which has been folded around a large branch sticking out from beneath the top of the tree. He is holding a long stick of some sort, seemingly attempting to threaten Beret Guy, as the stick and his legs are vibrating as indicated with small lines.]\nBeret Guy: Morning, mister Cooper!\nCooper: You help me down this instant![Pan down to show only Beret Buy and nothing else. Cooper replies from off-panel from the top corner.]\nBeret Guy: Do you promise to give back all the money you took?\nCooper [off-panel]: Never!\nBeret Guy: Okay! See you tomorrow![Megan and Beret Guy continue walking through the landscape with three small trees behind them, as well as grass, rocks and a small puddle. Megan looks back over her shoulder towards where Cooper is hanging.]\nMegan: Was that D.B. Cooper?\nBeret Guy: Yeah, and up ahead there's an owl nest!\nBeret Guy: There's so much neat stuff here."
