  "transcript": "[Cueball holding his smartphone in both hands is talking to White Hat.]\nCueball: This new keyboard is like 30% faster! I'm never going back.[White hat replies and Cueball lifts his arms.]\nWhite Hat: Good, put those years of horror behind you.\nCueball: C'mon. Sure, sometimes my focus on efficiency doesn't make sense. But we type a lot.[Cueball holding his smartphone in one hand while talking to White Hat.]\nCueball: That 30% improvement pretty quickly adds up to a huge amount of wasted time rescued.[White hat replies and Cueball lifts one arm.]\nWhite Hat: I just watched you open Google News and then close it without reading it five times in a row.\nCueball: The fact that I spend most of my time so stupidly only makes it more important not to waste any here."
