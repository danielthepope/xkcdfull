  "transcript": "[White Hat and Cueball are walking to the right.]\nWhite Hat: Thanks to deepfakes, soon we won't know what's real anymore. Video will become meaningless.[White Hat and Cueball walk on, Cueball lifts one hand with the palm up.]\nCueball: I dunno.\nCueball: We've had Photoshop for decades and staged photos for centuries.\nCueball: It hasn't made photos meaningless.[Zoom in on Cueball, who is turned left towards off-panel White Hat.]\nCueball: The bottleneck for fake stuff isn't technical. The bottleneck is willingness to lie.\nCueball: \"People lying\" is a very old problem.\nCueball: It's a known exploit.[Zoom back out on White Hat and Cueball who have stopped. White Hat has a hand on his jaw. Cueball holds his hands out to the sides.]\nWhite Hat: I guess technically we've been able to make text deepfakes for 5,000 years.\nCueball: Maybe Ea-nasir's copper ingots were actually fine!"
