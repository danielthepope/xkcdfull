  "transcript": "[Hairy is speaking into a microphone while interviewing Megan.]\nHairy: Tell us, are you scientists excited for the eclipse?\nMegan: Sure, lots of people are![Zoom in on Megans head.]\nHairy (off-panel): Is this a big moment for science?\nMegan: It's a big moment for the sky.[Same setting as first panel in a wider panel.]\nHairy: Are people really excited enough about science to travel to see it?\nMegan: Honestly, it's not that scientific. I mean, it's cool if you're into astronomy, but it's also cool if you're, like, aware of the sun.[Same setting.]\nHairy: But there's lots of science involved.\nMegan: I guess? There's lots of science involved in the Olympics, but you don't need to be a scientist to watch.[Megan holds a hand out towards Hairy.]\nMegan: It's not like the concept is all that arcane or mathematical. It's a thing going in front of another thing.[Zoom in on Megan holding both arms out.]\nHairy (off-panel): Then why are you so excited?\nMegan: I'm excited because it's a nearly once-in-a-lifetime chance to watch the sun go dark, hear birds freak out, and see a glowing ring appear in the sky with a sunset on every horizon.[Back to same setting as in the first panel.]\nHairyÂ : Will you be making any scientific observations?\nMegan: I will be like, \"Holy shit, look at the sky.\"\nMegan: Maybe also \"This is so cool.\"\nMegan: We'll see!"
