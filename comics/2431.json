  "transcript": "[Cueball checking his phone in a narrow panel.]\nCueball: Can't believe it's already March.\nBlack Hat (off-screen): Nah, it's February 29th.[Cueball has put his phone away and is standing next to Black Hat.]\nCueball: It's not a leap year.\nBlack Hat: I decided to make it one. Every year deserves to leap.\nCueball: Can you do that?\nBlack Hat: Can anyone stop me?[Zoom in on Cueball.]\nCueball: I guess if you just encourage people to call March 1st \"February 29th\", they can go along with it if they want. Just a one-day renaming.\nBlack Hat (off-screen): No, tomorrow will be March 1st.[Cueball standing to Black Hat, who is walking off screen to the right, with his finger raised.]\nCueball: So you're causing calendar drift for future generations.\nBlack Hat: If they didn't want to experience consequences, they shouldn't have decided to live in the future."
