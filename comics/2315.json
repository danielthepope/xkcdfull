Cueball still sitting at his desk. He has his hand on his chin.]\nLaptop: The system needs to guarantee eventual consistency.\nCueball: I mean, it does.[Closeup of Cueball.]\nCueball: Eventual consistency is guaranteed by the 2nd law of thermodynamics.\nCueball: Sooner or later this will all be a uniform heat bath.\nCueball: Maximum entropy.[Back to Cueball and desk.  Cueball is leaning back in his chair.]\nLaptop: Maximum entropy means no useful work can be done!\nCueball: I'm getting a head start by doing no useful work now."
