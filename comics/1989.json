Their readers are messing with us.[Cueball and Megan look at Ponytail.]\nPonytail: Are you sure? I always used it to mean \"honest.\"\nMegan: ...What?![Close up of Cueball holding a phone. A box with usage of \"IMHO\" and \"TBH\" from Google Trends shows \"TBH\" suddenly rising in 2011, with a second spike in 2014.]\nCueball: It was definitely \"humble\" in the 1990s.\nCueball: Maybe people who picked it up after the rise of \"TBH\" in 2011 interpreted it as \"honest\" and used it that way.[Cueball, Megan, and Ponytail as before.]\nMegan: I can't get over this. What other wrong opinions do you have?\nMegan: The \"G\" in \"G-I-F\"?\nPonytail: Silent.[Close up of Ponytail, with Megan talking from offscreen.]\nMegan: The \"S\" in \"SMDH\"?\nPonytail: \"Swallowing.\"\nMegan: The \"G\" in \"OMG\"?\nPonytail: \"Giantess\" or \"genitals.\"[Cueball, Megan, and Ponytail as before.]\nMegan: The Dress?\nPonytail: Black and white.\nMegan: Is the database language \"sequel\" or \"ess cue ell\"?\nPonytail: I've always said \"squill.\"Cueball: Okay, the big one: how many spaces after a period?\nPonytail: None; I use tabs.\nCueball: OMG.\nMegan: Yeah, mine too."
