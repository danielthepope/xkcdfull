  "transcript": "[Megan, Cueball, and White Hat are standing in a group. Cueball is talking.]\nCueball: COVID has made me so curious about colds. The next time I get one, I want to know which virus it is specifically.\nCueball: A Rhinovirus? RSV? Mild Influenza? Or something weird like Metapneumovirus?[Megan, Cueball, and White Hat are talking.]\nMegan: How distinct are they? Could you learn to tell them apart?\nCueball: See, I wonder!\nWhite Hat: I could get a sequencer from work...[In this panel, Cueball is sitting on the left, Megan is sitting on the right, and White Hat is standing at the far right. Megan is coughing, there is a tissue box in the middle, and rolled-up tissues lying around on the ground.]\nCaption above the panel: Several years later...\nCueball: Ah yes, this one has the rich, full-bodied bouquet of RSV, but the heady congestion lends it a lingering Rhinovirus nosefeel.\nMegan: *Cough* Quite right!"
