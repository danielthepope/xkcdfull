  "transcript": "How Well I Understand Orbital Mechanics:\n[There is a graph with the x-axis labeled as 'time' increasing to the right. The y-axis is unlabeled but it can be assumed that it could be labeled 'understanding'.]\nThe line stays flat until the first bump, which is annotated \"Took High School Physics\".\nThe line decreases, then grows to a higher maximum with the annotation \"Got Physics Degree\".\nThere is a small amount of decrease until a gradual bump in the graph labeled \"Actual Job At NASA\".\nIt gradually decreases to pre-NASA levels, but then begins to increase exponentially. The annotation reads \"Started Playing Kerbal Space Program\"."
