  "transcript": "[Cueball sitting in front of his lap top typing. The text above him is the one he is typing. The last word résumé has too many diacritics. The u has an umlaut (as in ü) and the last é has no less than six diacritics; a cedilla below (as in ȩ), a ring above (as in e̊ ), then three acute accents above the ring (as in é), and finally they are topped off by a breve (as in ĕ). Also, the last full stop has three accents \"´\" above it:]Cueball (typing): Attached please fīnd my résümȩ̊́́́̆.́́́[Caption below the panel:]\nI usually leave out diacritics when I type, so I make up for it by occasionally adding a whole bunch at once."
