  "transcript": "[Megan is walking up to Science Girl with a bow in her hair bun. Science Girl has a stack of three books in front of her, is reading another book and a fifth book lies behind her on the floor.]\nMegan: What are you reading about?\nScience Girl: Dinosaurs!\nMegan: Oh, yeah.[Zoom out of the same scene, with Megan standing and Science Girl looking up at her.]\nMegan: They've gotten all weird since when I was a kid.\nMegan: They used to be awesome, but now they all have dorky feathers, right?\nScience Girl: Yup![Same scene in a frame-less panel. Science Girl looks down and below the two characters there is a footnote.]\nScience Girl: This says they now think raptors used their wings for stability, flapping to stay on top of their prey while hanging on with their hooked claws and eating it alive.\n*Fowler et. al., PLoS ONE 6(12), 2011[Zoom in on the same scene, the book on the floor is outside the panel. Megan just stands staring at Science Girl who reads on. Beat panel.][Megan is now on the floor next to Science Girl flipping through the top book she has taken from the pile.]"
