  "transcript": "[Ponytail, White Hat, Megan, Cueball, and Hairy are standing around. Ponytail, White Hat, and Megan are wearing glasses in the shape of the number 2023 and holding party-related items. Hairy is on the other side of Cueball from them and is only carrying some item of clothing, probably a recently removed coat. Cueball carries nothing, and his attention is on the new arrival, possibly having to squint at him, as depicted by a set of short radial lines projecting away from where Cueball's eyes would be if they were ever drawn.]\nCueball: Hey Rob! Or, uh... \nCueball: Sorry, is that Mike?[Caption below the panel]:\nI'm regretting my New Year's Eve novelty \"2023\" laser eye surgery."
