  "transcript": "[Megan is carrying a box with biohazard symbols on it towards a desk where Ponytail (wearing safety glasses) is working on a laptop, across from Cueball (also wearing safety glasses) who is putting a test tube into a centrifuge. There's also a flask on the desk.]\nPonytail: Feels like we missed the window for the \"COVID-19\" renaming. \"Coronavirus\" is just too catchy.\nCueball: But it's not specific! There are a lot of coronaviruses.[In a frameless panel, Ponytail (still wearing safety glasses) is pointing at a screen or picture showing a modern city skyline with a large spider crawling across three of the high-rise buildings.]\nPonytail: I think it's fine. It's like, you know the giant spider downtown that sits on the buildings and sometimes eats cars? I think technically it's a mutant T. annexa wolf spider, but everyone is just calling it \"the spider\" and we all know what they mean.[Back to the setting from the first panel. Megan is standing and Ponytail had turned towards her and Cueball has stepped back from the machine.]\nMegan: I've been meaning to ask, what's with that spider? Should we...do something?\nPonytail: Honestly I've been too busy with the virus stuff to look into it-I just changed my commute to avoid Main St.\nCueball: Yeah, that's fair. One thing at a time."
