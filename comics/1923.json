  "transcript": "[A thermometer is shown where the temperature is indicated, with a red column of liquid, to be just above room temperature. This can be seen from the five labels belonging to five lines pointing at the scale. None of these coincide with the 14 ticks on the actual scale for the thermometer. Below the last label is the formula for calculating the temperature on this scale.]\n92°⋲ world heat record\n68°⋲ body temperature\n47°⋲ room temperature\n16°⋲ water freezes\n–9°⋲ 0°F\n°⋲=7×°C/5+16=(7×°F–80)/9[Caption below the panel:]\nSince the Celsius vs Fahrenheit debate has proven surprisingly hard to resolve, as a compromise I've started using Felsius (°⋲), the average of the two."
