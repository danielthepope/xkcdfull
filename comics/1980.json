The boy reaches one hand to the plate.]\nPerson in the sled: Have some Turkish delight. If you betray your family, there's more where that came from.[The boy tastes one piece.][The boy looks at that piece.][The boy looks up, to the direction where the gift came from, the piece still in his hands.]\nBoy: Wow.\nBoy: This is...\nBoy: not great.[Caption below:]\nThe Narnia books gave me a really unrealistic impression of how good Turkish delight tastes."
