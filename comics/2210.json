  "transcript": "[Cueball, Ponytail and White Hat are having a conversation. Ponytail is checking her phone.]\nPonytail: Oh, huh. California passed a law giving college athletes full rights to their names and images.\nWhite Hat: Good, I think?[Cueball holds his hand up in a fist, while Ponytail, holding her phone down, and White Hat looks at him.]\nCueball: That's nothing. Our state gave college players rights to use the names and images of any California athletes.\nPonytail: It did not.[In a frame-less panel Cueball holds his hands out, Ponytail's phone is gone and White Hat puts a hand to his chin.]\nCueball: Sure it did!\nCueball: That's how our school fielded a basketball team made up entirely of Steph Currys.\nWhite Hat: Or is the plural \"Stephs Curry\"?[Cueball holds both hands up in front of him. Ponytail has her arms down but she is balling her hands into fists.]\nCueball: They didn't all copy the original Steph, though. One player got the rights to his name, then the next player got it from them, and so on.\nCueball: This process is known as \"currying\".\nPonytail: ...I hate you so much."
