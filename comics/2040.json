  "transcript": "[A single layer of a family tree with 15 people depicted as sticky figures side by side is shown. They are connected alternated either by a bracket on top or a short line between them. The four outermost figures on each side are faded out in gray.]\n[In the middle is Cueball and from below an arrow points at him:]\nMe\n[To the left Ponytail is connected by a bracket and the arrow below says:]\nSibling\n[To the right of Cueball Megan is shown connected by a small line, an arrow below her reads:]\nSpouse\n[Further to the left and the right the next figures have an arrow below with the nested text:]\nSiblings-in-law\n[The next connected figures on both sides are drawn with two other wider arrows embedding this statement:]\nAlso siblings-in-law, I think?\n[All remaining figures left and right have similar arrows below and the text is:]\nPossible additional siblings-in-law???[Caption below the frame:]\nPeople complain that “<X>th cousin <Y> times removed” is hard to understand, but to me the most confusing one is sibling-in-law, because it chains across both sibling and marriage links and I don't really know where it stops."
