  "transcript": "[Top caption, in the panel:]\nJames Webb Space Telescope\n[Subtitle of top caption:]\nLaunch Delays[There is a positive-quadrant only line graph. The x- axis is labeled 'Current Date' and the y axis is labeled 'Planned Launch Date'. The dates on both of the axes range from 1995 to 2030.]\n[In the graph are 15 points, starting at (1997,2007) and extending at a slope of a little less than one. The most recent one is labeled 'Now: 2021'.]\n[There are two lines on the graph: a red one and a dashed black one. The red one is a regression of the points on the graph. The black one is a line with a slope of one. They intersect at the point (2026,2026), marked by the label 'Late 2026'?][Caption below the panel:]\nLook, at least the slope is less than one."
