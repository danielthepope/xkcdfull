  "alt": "I just noticed CVS has started stocking homeopathic pills on the same shelves with--and labeled similarly to--their actual medicine. Telling someone who trusts you that you're giving them medicine, when you know you're not, because you want their money, isn't just lying--it's like an example you'd make up if you had to illustrate for a child why lying is wrong.",

  "transcript": "[Cueball and a friend stand in front of Cueball's bookcase. His friend flips through a number of them.]\nFriend: All your books are full of blank pages.\nCueball: Not true. That one has some ink on page 78.\nFriend: A smudge.\nCueball: So?Friend: There are no words. You're not reading. There's no story there.\nCueball: Maybe not for you. When I look at those books, I think about all kinds of stories.Cueball: Reading is about more than what's on the page. Holding a book prompts my mind to enrich itself. Frankly, I suspect the book isn't even necessary.Cueball: The whole industry is evil. Greedy publishers and rich authors try to convince us our brains need their words. But I refuse to be a sucker.\nFriend: Who sold you all these blank books?"
