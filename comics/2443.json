  "transcript": "[Megan is walking toward Cueball, who is holding his arm.]\nMegan: How you feeling?\nCueball: Not bad. Tired. A little sore.[Zoom in on Cueball. He looks down at his arms, which are held out.]\nCueball: I feel bad for my immune system. It doesn't know this isn't a real virus. It must be freaking out. \nCueball: Hey buddy, don't worry! We're going to be fine. This is just practice![Zoom out. Megan gestures at Cueball, as he holds his arm.]\nMegan: No, don't tell it that. You want it to panic and build defenses that will be able to handle the real thing.\nCueball: I guess. \nCueball: Okay, let me try that again. \nCueball: *ahem*[Cueball dramatically clutches at his chest.]\nCueball: Woe! My arm is stricken by a dreadful plague! \nCueball: I feel death draw near! My only hope is those heroic immune cells!\nMegan: Perfect.\nCueball: Psst - you're doing great! I'm so proud of you."
