Prometheus is holding his hand to his chin and holding a colorful flaming torch in the other hand.]\nCueball: Prometheus has stolen fire from the Gods!\nPrometheus: \nWell, sort of. \nI mean, when you use a fire to make another fire, the first fire doesn't go away. \nSo really, it's more like \"sharing\".[Caption below the frame:]\nFire wants to be free."
