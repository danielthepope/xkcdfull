  "transcript": "[Megan, Ponytail, and Black Hat are standing around.]\nMegan: I've been out of school for years, but I still get those dreams where I have an exam and I didn't prepare.[Ponytail shrugs.]\nPonytail: I think that's one of those weird universal dreams— like forgetting your clothes or discovering rooms in your house you didn't know about.[Zoom-in on Black Hat.]\nBlack Hat: Yeah! Or when you're having a normal dream, but then a horse appears on a distant hilltop, and it means that the dream is about to turn bad!\nPonytail or Megan (off-screen): I... What?\nBlack Hat: I have that one like every night.[Megan and Ponytail look at Black Hat.]\nBlack Hat: Or those ones where you're talking to someone, and they start repeating a latitude and longitude over and over, and then you wake up that morning and there's an earthquake there. \nBlack Hat: Haha, dreams, right? So weird!"
