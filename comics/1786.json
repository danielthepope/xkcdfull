  "transcript": "[Cueball looking at garbage chute attached to wardrobe. A Black Hat answers him from off panel.]\nCueball: What's this thing on your wardrobe?\nBlack Hat (off-panel): Garbage chute.[In a frame-less panel Cueball has turned away from the wardrobe (now off-panel) and he walks towards Black Hat.]\nCueball: Into a wardrobe?  \nBlack hat: There's some sort of portal to a magical land in there. Half the furniture I get has them-it's kinda a pain.[Cueball stops walking closer to Black Hat.]\nCueball: You dump your trash in Narnia?  \nBlack Hat: Yeah, it's a real time-saver.  \nBlack Hat: There's a huge cat in there, but I have a spray bottle I use when he tries to come up through the chute."
