  "transcript": "[Dr. Fauci is putting on a white lab coat and dancing.  A fish tank stands on an end table to the right.  Inside, there is a fish looking at him as well as a seaweed-like plant and a small castle. Music notes are scattered about Fauci's speech.]\nDr. Fauci: ♫ Putting on my doctor coat ♫[Dr. Fauci is buttoning the coat.  He is now to the right of the fish tank.]\nDr. Fauci: ♫ It's the coat I wear ♫[Dr. Fauci is back to the left of the fish tank, looking himself in a mirror, and touching his face.]\nDr. Fauci: ♫ so they know how good a doctor I am ♫\nOff-panel voice: Dr. Fauci?  The press conference is in five.\nDr. Fauci: Be right there![Caption below the panel:]\nIt's nice to think about how serious and important people probably also absentmindedly sing made-up songs to pets."
