  "transcript": "[Megan looking at a large screen with many green and red squares. The squares have writing in them and lines connecting them.]\n[Side view. The screen is a huge LCD connected to a wireless router.]\nCueball: Pretty, isn't it?\nMegan: What is it?\nCueball: I've got a bunch of virtual Windows machines networked together, hooked up to an incoming pipe from the net. They execute email attachments, share files, and have no security patches.\nCueball: Between them they have practically every virus.\nCueball: There are mail trojans, warhol worms, and all sorts of exotic polymorphics. A monitoring system adds and wipes machines at random. The display shows the viruses as they move through the network. Growing and struggling.\n[Cueball walks past the girl and touches the monitor.]\nMegan: You know, normal people just have aquariums.\nCueball: Good morning, Blaster. Are you and W32.Welchia getting along?\nCueball: Who's a good virus? You are! Yes, you are!"
