  "transcript": "[Cueball and Megan kneel on a bed, Cueball, on the foot of the bed, is shaking a cup of dice. Behind Megan is a pillow and the bed poles.]\nCueball: All right, baby. Get ready for...\nShake shake shake roll[There is no frame around the next drawing of the two dice that have been rolled. The first is a regular five (seen almost from the top, but the sides with one and three can be seen). The second die has text written on it:]\nBreasts[Cueball and Megan are bent over the dice lying on the bed staring at them. Beat panel.][Cueball leans back on one hand while taking the other to his chin while Megan sits straighter.]\nCueball: I really need to organize the game cupboard.\nMegan: Wait, so where's the other sex die?[A Cueball-like guy lies on his stomach, and another Cueball-like guy sits to the left. Hairbun is sitting and Ponytail also lying on her stomach, hands beneath her chin. They are sitting/lying down around a game board. On the board is what appears to be two dice.]\nGuy lying: I... fondle the castle guard? That doesn't seem right.\nHairbun: It did 6 damage, though."
