  "transcript": "[Two situations are depicted between White Hat and Cueball.]\n[Situation 1:]\nWhite Hat: You should keep watching! After the first season it gets really good.\nCueball: Oh yeah, I've heard that!\n[Situation 2:]\nWhite Hat: You should keep watching! After the first 8 movies, they get really good.\nCueball: Haha, what? I'm not going to sit through eight bad movies!\n[Caption below the panel:]\nIt's weird how it's way more normal and socially acceptable to suggest someone spend 10-15 hours watching something when it's TV rather than movies."
