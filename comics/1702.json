Everyone always has weird home remedies that never work. I just want sympathy.\nCueball (off-panel): No, this one isn't weird, I promise. It really helps![A frame less panel with a zoom-out back to Megan and Cueball. Megan is still scratching loudly and Cueball still holds his hand up.]\nCueball: First, take a hot shower.
