  "transcript": "Grey on white diagram of the Earth orbiting the Sun, not to scale.  Earth is depicted as a circle with pale grey continents on darker grey seas, and shows a view from above the North Pole without any Arctic ice. The sun is drawn surrounded by radially symmetrical exaggerated wave pattern.\nAlso in grey, approximate locations of Lagrange points 1 to 5 are marked with dots and labels: \"L1\" \"L2\" \"L3\" \"L4\" \"L5\". \nIn black, a point on the Earth's surface within the boundary of a continent that could be North America. Also in black, an arrow pointing towards the point, and the label \"L6\".\n[Caption below the panel:]\nHuge space news: Astronomers have discovered a new Lagrange point just outside Cleveland."
