No tax or anything?\nPonytail: That's right.[Megan stares at the apple in a frameless panel.][Scene zooms in on Megan.]\nPonytail: ...Is that a problem?\nMegan: It's just weird to realize that every other transaction in my life will be more complicated than this.[Scene changes focus to Ponytail behind the counter.]\nMegan: This is like a platonic ideal exchange. An apple for a dollar.\nPonytail: I see.[Scene changes back to Megan, once again lost in profound contemplation of the apple.]\nMegan: Are we on a frictionless plane? Is a train leaving Chicago at 40 mph? Should I solve for something??\nPonytail: Okay, apples are $2.17 now.\nMegan: That's... probably better for us both."
