  "transcript": "[Cueball is sitting in an office chair at his desk, hands on his keyboard, looking at his desktop. Lyrical text is written upon each scene as an unspoken narration]\nI heard there was a secret chord\nThat David pressed and it typed a word[A closeup on Cueball. We see him from the waist up]\nBut you don't use a chorded keyboard, do you[The third frame is like the first, except Cueball's arms are moved]\nIt goes like this, <control> and <shift>\nThe other hand hits H and <left>[The fourth frame is like the first and third, but the arms are moved again.
