I broke Bob's private key and extracted the text of her messages. But does anyone realize how much it hurt?\nEve: He said it was nothing, but everything from the public-key authenticated signatures on the files to the lipstick heart smeared on the disk screamed \"Alice.\"\nEve: I didn't want to believe. Of course on some level I realized it was a known-plaintext attack. But I couldn't admit it until I saw it for myself.\n[Eve places her hands on her hips.]\nEve: So before you so quickly label me a third party to the communication, just remember: I loved him first. We had something and she tore it away. She's the attacker, not me. Not Eve."
