I emailed you, and you replied on Skype and mentioned that the email \"woke you up\".\nCueball: You're very responsive - I just have no sense of how you use technology.\n[An owl flies into the panel.]\nCueball:Â ?!?\n[The owl perches on Cueballs's head. It has delivered a note to Cueball.]\nNote: did you try to call me? use my google voice number next time."
