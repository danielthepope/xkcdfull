Hairy stands behind him.]\nCueball: I'm trying to figure out which of these credit card rewards programs is best given my spending.[Cueball leans backwards in a frameless panel.]\nCueball: But at some point, the cost of the time it takes me to understand the options outweighs their difference in value.[Close-up of Cueball's head and torso.]\nCueball: So I need to figure out where that point is, and stop before I reach it.\nCueball: But... when I factor in the time to calculate THAT, it changes the overall answer.[Cueball has his arms outstretched.]\nHairy: I question the assumption that you'd otherwise be spending your time on something more valuable.\nCueball: Come on, I could be failing to optimize so many better things!"
