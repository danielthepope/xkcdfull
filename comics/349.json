Megan is not shown in the panel but may be off-panel unless Cueball is talking to himself.]\nLabel: 6 hours\nCueball: I'll be happy if I can get the system working like it was when I started.[Cueball is standing in front of the computer, which now has a laptop plugged into the tower.  Megan is still not shown in the panel but may be off-panel again.]\nLabel: 10 hours\nCueball: Well, the desktop's a lost cause, but I think I can fix the problems the laptop's developed.[Cueball and Megan are swimming in the sea; an island and a beach can be seen in the distance.]\nLabel: 24 hours\nCueball: If we're lucky, the sharks will stay away until we reach shallow water.\nMegan: If we make it back alive, you're never upgrading anything again."
