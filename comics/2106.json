Other people and clouds visible floating by in background.]\nScreen: Welcome to social media! When you put stuff here, you have two options: (1) You can make it available to a small set of 300 or so approved friends. \nScreen: Or (2) you can share permanent copies of it all with billions of people, including internet scammers, random predatory companies, and hostile governments.Cueball: Why would anyone pick option two?\nScreen: Two is the default.\nCueball: Yikes.Cueball: So those are the only two options? There’s nothing in in between?\nScreen: I don’t understand. Like what?Cueball: I mean…there are numbers between 300 and a billion.\nScreen: Huh? Name one.\nScreen: Pretty sure I would have heard of those."
