It appears to be the torn paper of the comic itself. A light-blue, sky-like background is revealed. Megan jumps in surprise, nearly tipping over her chair.]\n[Megan stands up as the chair falls over completely.]\n[Wide view. Megan looks back at the door furtively.]\n[She begins to climb into the hole.]\n[By now, Megan is entirely inside the hole. She is closing it behind her.]\n[Only her head and arms are visible.]\n[The hole is closed, revealing a formation of ripped paper.]\n[Large frame, where Megan appears to be in space, with blue not black background. Stars dot the sky, and rays of light seem to originate from a point to the right, and then traverse the frame both horizontally and vertically, almost like lightning. Megan is in a bubble, floating disconnectedly. Both she and the bubble have become white, tinged against the backdrop.]"
