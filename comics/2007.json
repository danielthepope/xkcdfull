  "transcript": "[A single panel contains a simplified overhead map view of the Brookhaven Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and some of the surrounding area. The map is rotated 90Â°; north is to the left. The collider is located on the left hand side of the image as a yellow beam (representing the Gold ions) outlined in black.  Parts of the collider are are labeled and there are light gray arrows indicating the direction of travel for the ions.  At the bottom of the main accelerator ring there is a diverter that splits the ion beam and directs it towards a set of three Cash for Gold stores, passing through a more diverters along the way.  Each Cash for Gold store is represented with a yellow burst and is marked with a Google maps style \"store\" locator pin. The following labels are written on the map.]Brookhaven Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider\nGold Ion Source\nAccelerator Ring\nDiverter\nGold Ion Beam[There are arrows coming from this label pointing at each store]\nCash for Gold Stores[Caption below the panel:]\nSadly, Brookhaven rejected my proposed experiment"
