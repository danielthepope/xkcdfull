  "transcript": "[Irregular bands of gray are shown, shading from a white circular segment on the bottom left side of the panel to completely black on the right. The bands have pixelated edges. A small white space probe is shown just outside the last dark gray band, in the completely black are. A dotted line starting from inside the dark gray ending at the space probe indicated that it is moving to the right out of the gray area. Close to the white area there are many bands packed closely together and with hard to define edges. But there are five gray areas clearly separated from the white, with a tendency to be elongated towards the space probes direction. There is a caption below the panel:]\nMilestone: Voyager has passed through the streaming video compression artifacts that mark the edge of the solar system"
