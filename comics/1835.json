  "transcript": "[The comic shows curves plotted in an (x,y)-plane. The x-axis shows years from 2004 to 2017, with every even year labeled. The y-axis is labeled \"popularity relative to peak (based on google trends)\". There are five vaguely bell-shaped curves, each stretching over 9-10 years. It is implied that they rise from a value close to zero, to which they also return.]The curve labeled \"robot monkeys\" peaks in early 2005 and ends near the x-axis in late 2011.\nThe curve labeled \"pirates vs ninjas\" peaks in late 2008 and ends in late 2014. \n[The remaining three curves all end in mid 2017, the comic release date. ]\nThe curve labeled \"zombies\" starts in late 2007 and peaks in early 2013. By 2017 it has fallen to about 30% of its peak value.\nThe curve labeled \"bacon\" starts in late 2009 and peaks in mid-2015. By 2017 it shows a value of about 90% of its peak value.\nThe curve labeled \"definition of a sandwich\" starts in late 2013 and in 2017 it has reached approximately half its peak value.[Text below the panel:]\nJudging from Google Trends, these random semi-ironic obsessions seem to last about nine or ten years, so we should be done with the sandwich thing by 2024."
