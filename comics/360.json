You don't watch sitcoms.\nCueball: Yeah, but it sucks having political campaigns without Jon Stewart's commentary.\nBlack Hat: True. I finally got sick of it a couple weeks ago.\nCueball: And you quit following the campaigns?\nBlack Hat: No. I kidnapped Jon Stewart to do analysis for me.\nCueball: You what?\n[Black Hat points at a door.]\nBlack Hat: He's locked in the basement.\nBlack Hat: Jon! Obama's leading in Iowa! Gimme a wry, witty comment on the situation!\nJon Stewart [Voice coming from door]: Please let me go. I have a family."
