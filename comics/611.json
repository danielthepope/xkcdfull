  "transcript": "[Megan is watching TV. Black Hat is leaning on the back of her chair.]\nMegan: I've realized that I always secretly root for hurricanes. I watch the news hoping that they'll get really big and hit a city. I know my hopes don't actually affect it, but I feel bad.Black Hat: Nah, that's just natural human attraction to spectacle. It's like watching the shuttle launch because you don't want to miss it if there's a disaster.\nMegan: ...I guess?Black Hat: Or dressing as an intern to sneak into operating rooms, in case a patient dies and you can watch them harvest organs.\nMegan: Wait, you do that?Black Hat: Or stealing detour signs to direct highway drivers down backwoods roads strewn with caltrops. After the tires burst, you start shooting out their windows.Black Hat: Then, when they flee the car in terror, you hunt them on horseback, like men once did.\nMegan: I realized a while back that we're having entirely different conversations."
