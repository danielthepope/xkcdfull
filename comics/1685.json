The first and last line are partly obscured by the frame of the panel. Here below is an attempt to transcribe the code, using the sign \"Â¤\" for anything not easily transcribed. Feel free to add other signs instead of these that looks more like the one in the image (and also improve the attempted transcription if possible).][Caption below the panel:]\nProtip: If you don't have access to the GNU patch tool, you can use the Photoshop one."
