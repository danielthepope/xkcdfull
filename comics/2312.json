  "transcript": "Megan: Odd how in physics \"mb\" is both millibars (pressure) and millibarns (area).\nMegan: mbmb could mean millibar-millibarn, which is a unit of force, strangely.\nWhite Hat: Units are weird.Cueball: So what's mbmbam, the My-Brother-My-Brother-And Me unit?\nMegan: Millibar-milliibarn-attometer, I guess? That'd be a unit of energy. 10-47 Joules.\nWhite Hat: \"One podcast\"Cueball: 10-47 sounds small.\nMegan: Yeah, it's roughly the energy you'd need to lift one yeast cell by one Planck length in Earth's gravity. \nWhite Hat: Planck yeast!Cueball: Doesn't Planck yeast rise on its own?\nMegan: Yeah, that's what makes quantum foam. But data suggests our universe is flat.\nMegan: String theory says it's because spacetime has unleavened dimensions.\nWhite Hat: ...I hate you."
