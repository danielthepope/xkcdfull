A juice bottle, empty cardboard box, opened tin can, bottlecap, crumpled and flat sheets of paper, a soda or pop can, and miscellaneous junk are visible.]\nCueball: This guy tears the labels off his cans, so he clearly understands they're going to be sorted somewhereâ€”\nCueball: Yet in the same batch he includes a bottle with like an ounce of congealed juice in it.\nCueball: What an asshole.I worry a lot about what the people at the recycling center think of me."
