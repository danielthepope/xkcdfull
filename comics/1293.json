We're headquartered here, in this real building I found![Both people sit down at a table. The 'hire' has a tray with food and a beverage. Beret Guy has a bowl. In the adjacent wall, there is a power outlet with a paper label taped to it marked \"Soup\". A small roll of wire sits next to Beret Guy's chair.]\n'Hire': What do you.. do?\nBeret Guy: We make stuff for phones! Like apps and stickers.[Beret Guy grabs the roll of wire.]\nBeret Guy: We want to hire you to write on our computers. We can offer you a bunch of paychecks! There are ghosts here.[Beret Guy unrolls the wire and plugs it into the wall.]\n'Hire': ...Are you sure this is a company?\nBeret Guy: I hope so![Soup (or something one can only hope is soup) streams out of the plugged-in wire into Beret Guy's bowl.]"
