  "transcript": "[Megan, arms spread out, is delivering a long-winded explanation to Hairbun and Cueball.]\nMegan: Imagine Earth's history as a football field, from the planet's formation at one end to today at the other.\nMegan: Complex life would be largely limited to the final ten yards. Dinosaurs appear at the five-yard line, the age of mammals happens in the last 1Â½ yards, and humans arise in the final few millimeters.\nMegan: All of written history would fit in a strip narrower than a single hair.\nMegan: \"Two weeks\" would be too small to see even with a powerful microscope.\nHairbun: Mm hmm.[Caption below the panel:] \nGeologists always try this when they're late turning something in."
