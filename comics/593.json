  "transcript": "[Weird root vegetables surround a strange script.][Megan holding up book to Cueball.]\nMegan: This is the Voynich manuscript— a book, allegedly 500 years old, written in an unrecognized script. It's some kind of visual encyclopedia of imaginary plants and undeciphered \"recipes\".[Megan points while Cueball opens the book.]\nMegan: It could be a hoax, a lost language, a cipher, an alien text, glossolatia — no one knows.\nCueball: No one? But it's obvious.[Megan continues to talk. Cueball holds the now closed book.]\nMegan: ... Obvious? Linguists and cryptographers have been stumped for decades.\nCueball: They forget. Human nature doesn't change.[Close up of Megan and Cueball - the book is off panel.]\nCueball: Just imagine someone found a book from our time, full of lists, illustrations, tables, and long, dry descriptions of nonexistent worlds written in an invented language. What have they found?\nMegan: ...Dear Lord. It is obvious.[Three people are standing around pawns and a die. One is holding a sheet of paper, another is holding a book, the third is holding a scythe. At the top of the panel there is a frame with the following text:]\n500 Years Earlier:\nPerson #1: Forsooth! I concoct an elixer of courage.\nPerson #2: Nae! The source booke sayeth that requires some wolfsbane!\nPerson #3: Your druid doth lose two points."
