  "transcript": "[Cueball is sitting at a desk using a computer and White Hat walks in.]\nCueball: Ooh, trailer for The Martian!\nWhite Hat: What's that?\nCueball: Movie of a book I liked.\nWhite Hat: Should I read it?[Cueball pivots on chair and turns away from computer to face White Hat.]\nCueball: Depends. You know the scene in Apollo 13 where the guy says \"we have to figure out how to connect this thing to this thing using this table full of parts or the astronauts will all die?\nWhite Hat: Yeah?[Cueball pivots on chair again and resumes using computer while talking. White Hat looks at his smart phone.]\nCueball: The Martian is for people who wish the whole movie had just been more of that scene.\nWhite Hat: How on earth did that become a big-budget thing with Matt Damon?\nCueball: No idea, but I'm so excited."
