  "transcript": "[Beret Guy is speaking into a microphone standing in front Ponytail who is filming him with a camera, a coiled wire from the camera going down her bag and in front of her feet there is a sign. Megan is walking towards them with a briefcase looking down.]\nBeret Guy: I'm documenting my quest to meet with the CEO of Volvo.\nMegan: Get lost.\nSign: Volvo Cars [In a frame-less panel two security guards/police officers with peaked caps with white emblems are attempting to restrain Beret Guy and taking the camera away from Ponytail, or at least lifting it up in the air. Beret Guy is leaning to the right standing like a bow trying to get to the CEO. There is no sign of the sign.]\nBeret Guy: Wait! I've come so far! Just let me see him![They've reached the CEO, Cueball, sitting in an office chair behind his desk, which has the Volvo logo on it with the arrow up and out to the right of the circle around the word. He is sitting leaning his elbows on the table top where there is a round item on a foot as at the front of the desk as well as a box for the intercom. Ponytail is filming with the camera, and Beret Guy stand with the microphone down.]\nCEO: All right, you've reached me. What is it you want to talk about?\nLogo: Volvo[Same setting with Beret Guy talking into the microphone and the CEO leaning forward, pushing the bottom of the intercom. The other small item has disappeared.]\nBeret Guy: Do you realize how much your company's name sounds like \"vulva\"?\nCEO: Security?\nLogo: Volvo"
