  "transcript": "[External view of a the International Space Station (ISS) orbiting the blue Earth below, shown with white clouds as stripes below and black sky above. Dialog, written in white on the black sky, comes from within the ISS.]\nCueball (inside the ISS): Yes!\nPonytail (inside the ISS): What?\nCueball (inside the ISS): I got our downlink into a GeoIP database.[Internal view of the satellite, Cueball and Ponytail are floating weightlessly around, Cueball is at a laptop style computer mounted to the wall. They are in a white room, with black around, but due to being weightless in space, the room is turned on edge as to not give any semblance of a given up/down direction.]\nPonytail: Why?\nCueball: To mess with advertisers. Check it out.[A zoom in on the computer screen is shown, it shows an ad on a pink background. The ad has a heading and then shows two photos of long haired girls in sexy poses each with captions below and a labeled button at the bottom. The location (as messed up by Cueball) is written in gray, the rest of the text is in black, to indicate that this part of the text has been inserted in the ad based on the location.]\nMeet local girls in\nLow Earth Orbit\ntonight!\nTanya, 18 \nAmber, 19\nChat live"
