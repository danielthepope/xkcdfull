  "transcript": "[Black Hat, Cueball and Megan are standing and talking.]\nCueball: Everyone loves these eagles that take down drones, but ... I dunno.\nMegan: You gotta admit, it's pretty cool.[Close-up of Cueball.]\nCueball: Yeah, but ... training rare animals to hurl themselves at whirling machinery can only get us so far, you know?[In a frame-less panel the setting is back to that of the first panel.]\nCueball: At some point, it's like releasing police dogs onto freeways to attack speeding motorcycles.\nMegan: Also cool, but I see your point.[Black Hat lifts his hand and Cueball turns his face towards him.]\nBlack Hat: Plus, I just finished my autonomous drone that hunts eagles.\nCueball: Man, you are an entirely separate class of problem."
