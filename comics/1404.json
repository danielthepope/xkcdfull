  "transcript": "[Cueball and Megan are walking together in the foreground.]\nCueball: Hear about that \"impossible\" microwave thruster?[They stop walking and Cueball turns to face Megan.]\nMegan: Yeah. Let me get this straight â€” they pumped 20 kilowatts into a box under ambient conditions\n...and it only twitched a little?\nCueball: Yeah.[Zoomed out - they are seen in silhouette walking together again.]\nMegan: That's surprising. If you pumped 20 kilowatts into me, I'd twitch a lot.\nCueball: But you're not pushing on the quantum vacuum.\nMegan: I might be. I do a lot of things.\nCueball: I guess we can't be sure."
