  "transcript": "[Two square panels show identical sets of scattered black dots, with only the red additions being different.][The left panel shows a slightly rising red line drawn through the middle of the panel, passing near a few dots but not obviously related to most of them. A red text is below the dots:]\nR2=0.06[The right panel shows many of the dots connected by red lines to form a stick figure of a man resembling the constellation Orion, with the hand on the reader's right raised and holding an object. A red text is below the dots:]\nRexthor, the Dog-Bearer[A caption is below and spanning both panels:] \nI don't trust linear regressions when it's harder to guess the direction of the correlation from the scatter plot than to find new constellations on it."
