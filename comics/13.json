A pock-marked moon and a ringed planet are visible in the burgundy-colored sky.][The two guys are again seen standing at what is now know to be the lip of the canyon.]\nFriend: That's a pretty boring answer.[Next panel is the same as before.]\nCueball: Is not.[Last panel is the same as before.]\nCueball: It's the least boring answer imaginable."
