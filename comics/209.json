What's that you're in?\n[Close up on Beret Guy and his kayak. The tip of the pier can be seen.]\nBeret Guy: A two seat kayak!\nCueball: I see, but why do you have it?\n[Close up on Cueball. The tip of the kayak and the tip of the paddle can be seen. Beret Guy and the waterline cannot be seen.]\nBeret Guy: We'll find out! The future is a big place!\nCueball: So the kayak travels through time?\n[Slightly zoomed-out version of the third panel. The tip of the paddle has disappeared but the waterline is visible again.]\nBeret Guy: Sure! Just like everything else! It also goes over water. Come on!"
