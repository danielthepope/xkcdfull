Unreadable text is written on both side of the apple in two rows.]\nMegan: *Ahem* \nMegan: The state apple-growers' association has decided to formally call on President Donald Trump to resign.[A wider shot shows Beret Guy, Megan, and Cueball on a podium behind the lectern. The visible audience consist of a Cueball-like guy, Hairy, and Ponytail, who is holding a microphone to her mouth as she addresses those on the podium.]\nPonytail: Weren't you meeting to update the standards for new apple varieties?\nMegan: Yes, but we talked it over and this is what we decided. \nMegan: We feel strongly that this is important.[There is a narrow shot with a zoom in on Megan.]\nPonytail (off-panel): Did you discuss anything on your actual agenda?\nMegan: Thanks for the question! \nMegan: We did not.[Beret Guy, Cueball and Megan is again seen from the front behind the lectern, Megan's hair even more unkempt.]\nPonytail (off-panel): Do you have any apple-related announcements at all?\nMegan: Uh, apples are great. Best fruit. Everyone should buy 1,000 of them. \nMegan: We're a little distracted right now, okay??"
