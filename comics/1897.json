The sign also has two smaller signs left and right with unreadable text. The image is of poor quality, but trees and other obstacles next to the road can be seen. Darkness around the edges of the image could indicate that it is night and the landscape is only lit up by a cars head lights.]\nSign: Stop[Beneath the image there are two large gray buttons with a word in each:]\nNo Yes[Beneath the buttons are the following text:]\nAnswer quickly â€“ our self-driving car is almost at the intersection.[Caption beneath the frame:]\nSo much of \"AI\" is just figuring out way to offload work onto random strangers."
