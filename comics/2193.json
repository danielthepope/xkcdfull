  "transcript": "[Megan rubs a lamp held in her hands. A genie appears from the end of the lamp. The genie resembles the top half of Cueball's body, with a head, torso, and crossed arms, but with a squiggle representing a puff of smoke in place of his legs.]\nGenie: Greetings, mortal.  You have freed me. I will grant you one wish.\nMegan: Hmm.[Megan holding the lamp to her side. The genie is off-panel.]\nMegan: It's been over 30 years since Back to the Future came out.  Since then, probably hundreds of thousands of people have tried to dress as Marty McFly for Halloween.\nGenie: OK, and?[Megan, holding the lamp to her side, talking to the genie, who is floating in the air.]\nMegan: Of those people, one of them must have done the worst job.\nMegan: My wish is to see their costume.[Megan still holding the lamp and talking to the genie. The genie is exasperated, and has his hands raised.]\nGenie: Not a billion dollars? Flight? Infinite wishes?\nMegan: These wish things are always traps.\nMegan: Just show me the worst McFly and we'll call it even."
