  "transcript": "[A door seen from a hallway, with \"Teachers' Lounge\" on the glass, next to the door is a sign reading \"Award.\" Inside the door are two teachers talking.]\nMegan: My students drew me into another political argument.\nCueball: Eh; it happens.\nMegan: Lately, political debates bother me. They just show how good smart people are at rationalizing.\n[The two teachers continue talking. A third one is seen reading a book on a sofa.]\nMegan: The world is so complicated - the more I learn, the less clear anything gets. There are too many ideas and arguments to pick and choose from. How can I trust myself to know the truth about anything? And if everything I know is so shaky, what on Earth am I doing teaching?\nCueball: I guess you just do your best. No one can impart perfect universal truths to their students.\nMiss Lenhart: *ahem*\nCueball: ...Except math teachers.\nMiss Lenhart: Thank you."
