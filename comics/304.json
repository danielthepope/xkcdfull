Megan is seen outside reading a book by a glow.]\nFor a few weeks now, sometime past midnight, a girl has wandered past my apartment reading by flashlight.[Outside, Megan walking down the street passing under a street lamp.]\nI wonder why she's up so late.\nMaybe she's restless\nLike me.\nI wonder what story she's wrapped up in.I wonder if she lets anyone into that island of light.[Cueball sitting in a dark room.][Cueball has left the room.][Cueball standing on his doorstep at the top of a small flight of stairs, near the bottom of which Megan has stopped, no longer reading.]\nCueball: Hi! What are you reading?\nMegan: Orson Scott Card's 'Xenocide.' It's my favorite in the series!Cueball: Wait, you like it more than Speaker for the Dead or Ender's Game?\nMegan: Yeah![Cueball has gone back in the house, leaving Megan standing alone.][Cueball is sitting in the chair again.]\nAnd to think I loved her."
