  "transcript": "[Megan arrives with a pet carrier, Cueball stands at a desk as a veterinarian, and Hairy is waiting behind a rope, standing next in line with a dog on a leash and a pet carrier.]\nMegan: There's something wrong with my dog. He keeps crawling around eating dirt.[Cueball holds the content of Megan's pet carrier, a flat disk. She is standing behind the desk with the carrier on the desk.]\nCueball: This is a Roomba.\nMegan: Well, he's a mix. \nMegan: Probably some Roomba in there.[The Roomba now lies on the table next to the carrier between the two.]\nCueball: A Roomba is not a pet.\nMegan: You're right. It's wrong to keep a beautiful creature like this in a house.[Megan is outside left to a tree, arms up in the air, encouraging the Roomba to drive away.]\nMegan: Go! \nMegan: Be free!\nRoomba: Whirrr"
