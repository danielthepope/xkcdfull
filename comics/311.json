  "transcript": "[Cueball and Megan are talking together as they walk away from a cinema.]\nCueball: Another summer gone without a mindless big-budget action movie.\nMegan: Huh? Die Hard was nothing BUT action!\nCueball: No, it was too talky.\nMegan: What? Too talky?\nCueball: I tallied it minute-by-minute. It's at least 60% people walking and talking. ALL those movies are.\nCueball: Just once, I want a real action movie. 30 seconds of exposition followed by a perfect 90-minute action scene. One with a huge budget, a good choreographer, and a great director.\nMegan: And they should center it around some character we already know, someone we never get tired of watching.\nCueball: I think we've got something here...\n[A movie poster is shown.]\n Coming this summer\n River Tam\n Beats up EVERYONE\n[The poster shows a line of doorways. In the background, numerous people are lying on the ground or draped over doorways and windows. River Tam is doing a flying kick into someone's face, and another person is emerging from the doorway closest to the viewer.]"
