  "transcript": "[The page is set up like the missed connections area of Craigslist, with a list of messages from an individual to a person they weren't able to communicate with at the time. All readable text is in blue. There is a large heading at the top:]\nPersonals > Missed Connections[Below the heading there is a gray section in a black frame with two lines. The first line has a search box and a  drop down menu with text and two black arrows to the right of it. The second line has three check boxes and two other boxes, all empty. all boxes has white background. Text is written many places around these boxes (and on the drop down menu), it is written in black, but none of it is readable.][Below this gray section follows seven missed connections, the last being cut before the description of \"Me\" is finished, and the line visible is cut of, so the lower third of the letters are hidden below the comics frame.]"
