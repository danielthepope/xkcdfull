  "transcript": "[The panels are arranged top to bottom. The first is set above a larger image.]\nFriend: So, are you guys out of the woods?\nCueball: We don't know.\nFriend: Well, did the treatment work?\nCueball: We don't know.[Cueball's next few lines are set by themselves in their own panels, arranged around a larger image.]\nCueball: I always assumed that when you got cancer, they gave you a prognosis, then treated you, and at the end of treatment either you beat it or you died.[The diagram shows a simple highway. Starting at the bottom, with diagnosis for five lanes, the road travels through a cloud of treatment, after which two lanes disappear, and three continue. Later on, there's another off-ramp labeled 'cancer \"comes back\"', which loops back into the treatment cloud. Otherwise, the highway enters a later cloud called survive.]Cueball: And I knew sometimes it \"recurred,\" which I assumed meant back to square one.\nCueball: But that's turned out not to be quite right.[Back to Cueball and his friend.]\nCueball: Once most cancers spread out into your body, they're incurable.\nCueball: If your 10-year prognosis is 60%, that means a 40% chance that some cancer will slip past the treatment and get out.[The frame zooms in to show just Cueball.]\nCueball: So they kill all the cancer they can find, and then you're a \"survivor.\" But your odds are still 60%.[The panel zooms in further, now showing only Cueball's top half.]\nCueball: They can't scan for individual cancer cells. The only way to know if it worked is to wait for tumors to pop up elsewhere.\nCueball: If you go enough years without that happening then you were in the 60%.[The frame shows both people again.]\nCueball: And often the first sign is a cough or bone pain.\nCueball: So you spend the next five or ten years trying not to worry that every ache and pain is the answer to the question \"Do I make it?\"[There's an extra large panel, with a small one floating inside it.]\n[The panel shows fifty-two lanes emerging from the cloud of 'Treatment'. Signs show 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years, 6 years. Lanes branch off and fade into darkness earlier on the right, with some lanes continuing off the top of the panel.][Inset panel.]\nFriend: Man.\nFriend: Fuck cancer.\nCueball: Seriously."
