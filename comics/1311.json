  "alt": "Some future reader, who may see the term, without knowing the history of it, may imagine that it had reference to some antiquated bridge of the immortal Poet, thrown across the silver Avon, to facilitate his escape after some marauding excursion in a neighbouring park; and in some Gentleman's Magazine of the next century, it is not impossible, but that future antiquaries may occupy page after page in discussing so interesting a matter. We think it right, therefore, to put it on record in the Oriental Herald that the 'Shakesperian Rope Bridges' are of much less classic origin; that Mr Colin Shakespear, who, besides his dignity as Postmaster, now signs himself 'Superintendent General of Shakesperian Rope Bridges', is a person of much less genius than the Bard of Avon. --The Oriental Herald, 1825",

  "transcript": "(This is a series of quotes from various people of various timeframes. Each quote is followed by the author, the document of publication if applicable, and the year.)Notes from the pastIt's desirable every thing printed should be preserved, for we cannot now tell how useful it may become two centuries hence.\nChristopher Baldwin\n1834I predict that a century hence the Canadian people will be the noblest specimens of humanity on the face of the earth\nRev. John Bredin\n1863In the twenty-first century mankind will subsist entirely upon jellies.\nThe Booklover\n1903The twenty-first century baby is destined to be rocked and cradled by electricity, warmed and coddled by electricity, perhaps fathered and mothered by electricity.

Macfie Campbell\n1924Historians of the twenty-first century will look back with well-placed scorn on the shallow-minded days of the early twentieth century when football games and petting parties were considered the most important elements of a college education.\nMary Eileen Ahern, Library Bureau\n1926In the year A.D. 2014 journalists will be writing on the centenary of the great war — that is, if there has not been a greater war.\nF.J.M, The Journalist\n1934"
