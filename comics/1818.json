  "transcript": "[Science Girl asks Blondie a question which she answers while lifting her arm towards Science Girl.]\nScience Girl: Why is the sky blue?\nBlondie: Because air is blue.[Megan walks in from behind Science Girl.]\nMegan: No, the sky is blue because of Rayleigh scattering–\nBlondie: Nah, it's because air is blue. Blue light bounces off it and hits our eyes. Same as why anything is any color.[Zoom in on Blondie's face.]\nBlondie: It's why far-off mountains look blue – because of all the blue air in the way.[Zoom out to Megan standing longer from Science Girl than Blondie who has thrown her arms out. Science Girl is facing directly out towards the reader.]\nMegan: There's a specific quantum mechanism by which–\nBlondie: Yeah but there's a physics mechanism for every color. You don't have to get all quantum right away.[Frameless panel with Science Girl looking up at Blondie who stands holding her hands on her sides. Megan speaks from off-panel.]\nMegan (off-panel): ...OK, I guess.\nBlondie: Any other questions?\nScience Girl: How do planes stay up?[Blondie holds a finger up in front of Science Girl while Megan now is the one to throw out her arms.]\nMegan: Well, the airflow–\nBlondie: Tiny birds in the wings. Thousands. Flapping hard.\nScience Girl: WOW!\nMegan: NO!"
