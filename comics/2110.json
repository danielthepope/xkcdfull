  "transcript": "[A line graph with eight marks on the Y-axis and five marks on the X-axis.  The graph has four points represented by dots and connected by three lines between them.  Each dot has error bars coming out of the top and bottom of it.  The horizontal line delineating the end of each error bar has another set of smaller error bars attached to it.  These second error bars in turn have a still smaller third set of error bars attached to the end of them.  There is a final fourth set of very small error bars attached to the third set, for a total of 56 error bars][Caption below the panel:]\nI don't know how to propagate error correctly, so I just put error bars on all my error bars."
