  "transcript": "TV Romantic Drama Equation (Derived during a series of 'Queer as Folk' episodes)\n[A table shows equations for possible romantic pairings in a TV show. The equation under \"gay\" is n(n-1) 2+x(x-n); the equation under \"straight\" is x(n-x).]\nx: Number of male (or female) cast members.\nn: total number of cast members.[A graph plots pairings (for large casts) against cast makeup. Each of the above equations forms a curve. \"Gay cast\" starts high for an all male cast, dips down at 50/50 cast makeup, and then rises again for all female. \"Straight cast\" starts at zero for an all male cast, peaks at 50/50 cast makeup, and then drops to zero again for an all female cast. The two curves intersect at two points close to the middle.]"
