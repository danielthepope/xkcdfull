It could be long gone.[Cueball looks at Megan, who is still looking up.]\nMegan: That's Sirius. It's eight light-years away.[Cueball looks up again.]\nCueball: Oh.[Both look at one another.]\nCueball: Just think - the light from that star was emitted in the previous presidential administration.\nMegan: Hmm, doesn't pack quite the punch."
