  "transcript": "Cueball: I feel like by now I should know about the stock market.\nCueball: What is investing?  Do you just open a website and pick the companies you like?Ponytail: Well, you totally can.\nPonytail: But there's a lot of evidence that no investing strategy consistently picks stocks that outperform the average of the whole market.  A lot of fund management is a myth.Cueball (off-screen): Huh, okay.\nPonytail: But there's a weird corollary to that idea: it implies that, ignoring fees and stuff, it's just as hard to consistently lose money by picking bad stocks from an index.Ponytail: If someone could consistently buy bad stocks, you could beat the average by hiring them, letting them pretend to invest, then buying every stock except the ones they pick.\nPonytail: In a way, bad judgement is just as helpful as good judgement.Cueball: Oh my God.\nCueball: I can do that!\nPonytail: No, it's just an example--\nCueball: This is the job I was born for.[Text box: Soon...]\nCueball: Hey, this company's CEO wants revenge on the same ghost as me!  I'm buying!\nCueball: Ooh, and this one is planning to develop a \"Camping Roomba.\"  That's a sure bet!\nMegan: Drop companies #208 and #1434 from the index.\nWhite Hat: Done."
