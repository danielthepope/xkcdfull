  "transcript": "[Beneath two headings to the left and right are shown two aggressive-looking groups of people with only the four people in the front clearly shown for each group. Behind them five other people can be seen, but they are not drawn with the same solid line and are only partly shown behind the first four, but legs from all five in each group can be seen along with some heads (all Cueball like) and arms etc. The front of the left group consist of Hairy holding a fist up towards left, Megan with her arms crossed in front of her chest, Cueball holding a sign, using both hands, straight up above his head and another Cueball-like guy to the right is holding up a broken branch in one hand toward right. The person behind this last person is shown to hold up his fist towards right like Hairy does to the left. The sign shows a Crocs shoe in a circle with a strike through it going above the Crocs from top left to bottom right.  The front of the right group consist of Megan holding both her arms over her head hands folded into fist while looking towards left, Cueball holding a sign, using both hands, towards the right and up above Ponytails head, she is raising one hand in a fist to the left and finally a bald guy with glasses is brandishing a short sword in one hand toward right while holding his other hand palm up. The sign has three similar words written beneath each other.]\nLeft: Fashion Police\nRight: Grammar Police\nSign:\nTheir\nThey're\nThere[Below the two groups are eight points with bullets:]\nJudgemental and smug\nAngry about something deeply arbitrary\nStrong opinions backed by style guides\nAppreciate that the way that you are interpreted is your responsibility\nUnderstand that there's no way to \"opt out\" of sending messages by how you present yourself, and attempts to do so send strong messages of their own\nTo seem cool and casual, pretend to ignore them while understanding them very well\nVindictive about things that are often uncomfortably transparent proxies for race or social class\nFun to cheer on until one of them disagrees with you[Caption below the panel:]\nI just realized these are literally the same people"
