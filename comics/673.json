  "transcript": "[Caption above the first panel, which is lower than the rest:]\nComing this March from the makers of The Core...\n[Ponytail is standing on a raised platform looking through a huge telescope (exiting the panel to the left) in an observatory. To her right is a large station with three screens and two Cueball-like guys are standing on the floor to the of that right. Behind them is another station with a large panel showing two circles with an arrow pointing from the top left to the bottom right.]\nPonytail: The sun's fusion is failing!\nMan 1: Does that make sense?\nMan 2: Whatever.[Zoom in on the scene where Ponytail throws up her arms as she turns towards the two Cueball, still standing on the platform, but the rest of the background is white. The first Cueball turns around and points to the other Cueball who has also turned around and has taken a phone of the hook, the curled cord disappearing at the panels right edge.]\nPonytail: If we don't send a ship to restart it, it could go out completely! \nMan 1: Call NASA!\nMan 2 (into the phone): Assemble our hottest astronauts.[Another Cueball-like guy has taken the call, and still stands with the phone in hand, the cord attached to the phone hook on the panels left edge. He stands with the helmet of a space suit under his other arm, obviously being an astronaut. Behind him is a fourth Cueball-like guy, Megan and another Ponytail.]\nAstronaut: The earth bathed in eternal darkness? A night without a dawn? Not on my watch!\nAstronaut: Saddle up.[The same four characters are shown in silhouette on gray background (still only one with helmet under arm), casting huge shadows towards the bottom of the panel from the dim sun in the top center of the panel. Above the sun is written a tagline (for the movie) and at the bottom of the panels with shadows falling over it is a second smaller tagline:]\nIt's \nDaylight saving time.\nNever fall back."
