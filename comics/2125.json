  "transcript": "[Cueball is standing behind while Megan sits at a laptop.]\nMegan: Huh. Luna 2, the first artificial object to touch another world, carried a sphere made of steel Soviet flag emblems.[A patterned sphere is shown blowing up to pieces.]\nIt was designed to blow apart on impact, scattering tiny metal flags and ribbons across the surface of the moon.[Close-up of Cueball and Megan's faces.]\nCueball: So the first physical contact humans had with a heavenly body...\nMegan: ...was throwing a shrapnel grenade full of flags at it.\nCueball: Well, it's on-brand for us, at least."
