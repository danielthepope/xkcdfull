  "transcript": "[A rocket is about to launch. A small object is near the top of the rocket.]\nCountdown: T-Minus 2 minutes\nOffscreen Voice 1: Tank and booster are go for launch.\nOffscreen Voice 2: Safety console?\nOffscreen Voice 3: Check. Safety-\nOffscreen Voice 4: Wait.[The small object moves to further to the right.]\nOffscreen Voice 1: What is it?\nOffscreen Voice 2: On the live feed- a cool bird just flew past the tower![The launch scene now a background silhouette, the small object of everyone's attention is no longer on-panel.]\nOffscreen Voice 1: Whoa, what kind?\nOffscreen Voice 2: Like a hawk, maybe!\nOffscreen Voice 1: Could it be a vulture?\nOffscreen Voice 2: I doubt it. The wings were flat, not in a \"V\".\nOffscreen Voice 3: It could be an eagle!\nOffscreen Voice 2: Ooh![The scene is returns to full contrast, with at least a token attention being paid to it, once more.]\nOffscreen Voice 1: This is launch control. We have a possible sighting of a cool bird. Halt the countdown.\nOffscreen Voice 2: Someone get some binoculars up here!\nOffscreen Voice 3: I want to see!"
