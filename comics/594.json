In all panels the woman answers off-panel with a small starburst close to the right panels border indicating from where her speak emanates.]\nWoman's voice (off-panel): Ugh. Stupid uterus.\nCueball: Hey, your period is every 28 days, right?[Cueball is standing hands down.]\nWoman's voice (off-panel): Yes, why?\nCueball: Well, period = T = 1/f.\nWoman's voice (off-panel): So?[Cueball holds up a finger in front of him.]\nCueball: Using this, we can calculate something you already know.\nWoman's voice (off-panel): What?[Cueball is standing hands down.]\nCueball: Your uterus-hertz.\nWoman's voice (off-panel): If I could get up I'd smack you."
