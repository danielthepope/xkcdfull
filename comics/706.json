  "transcript": "[Cueball is talking to his Cueball like friend.]\nCueball: Sometimes I'm shocked to realize how many options I have.\nFriend: Oh?[The text is written above a half height frame with a zoom in on Cueball who shakes his fist.]\nCueball: Like, at any moment in any conversation, I could just punch the person I was talking to, and all these potentially life-changing events would unfold.[Zoom further out than the first panel with Cueball holding his arms out and his friends taking his hand to his chin.]\nCueball: It's only my mental rules that stop me from punching you, or stripping naked, or getting on a plane to Fiji. Sure, rules have reasons. But shouldn't you exercise that freedom at least once before you die?\nFriend: Hmm.[In very big black letters written vertically between the two panels:]\nWham[Cueball is knocked to the ground, dazed (three stars over his head) and bruised while his friend is looking down at him with his fist raised.]\nCueball: Okay, I should have seen that coming.\nFriend: But you couldn't! That's the beauty!"
