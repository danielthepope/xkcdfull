  "transcript": "[James Bond, drawn as Cueball, is strapped to a giant wheel suspended from the ceiling. Black Hat is standing next to two levers.]\nBlack hat: How do you like my centrifuge, mister Bond? When I throw this lever, you will feel centrifugal force crush every bone in your body.\n[Same scene, but a closer shot.]\nBond: You mean centripetal force. There's no such thing as centrifugal force.\nBlack hat: A laughable claim, mister Bond, perpetuated by overzealous teachers of science. Simply construct Newton's laws in a rotating system and you will see a centrifugal force term appear as plain as day.\n[Closer shot, only Bond's head is visible.]\nBond: Come now, do you really expect me to do coordinate substitution in my head while strapped to a centrifuge?\nBlack hat: No, Mister Bond. I expect you to die."
