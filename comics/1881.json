  "transcript": "[Black Hat stands in front of a store counter facing White Hat who stands behind.]\nBlack Hat: My drone keeps flying into the wrong rooms. Do you have anything to discourage it? \nWhite Hat: Sir, this is a pet store. Black Hat: Yeah, I was thinking one of those spray bottles for cats. \nWhite Hat: I don't think you can train a drone. [White Hat hands a spray bottle over the counter.]\nBlack Hat: Eh, they say that about cats, too. Plus, these days they probably all come with deep learning or whatever. Drones, I mean. Maybe cats too. \nWhite Hat: Fine, here's a bottle. Black Hat: Do you sell a shock collar that can fit around a Roomba? \nWhite Hat: I'm going to have to ask you to leave."
