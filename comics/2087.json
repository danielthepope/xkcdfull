  "transcript": "[A rocket with two boosters is shown at the bottom left hand corner of the image taking off from a launch pad on the ground, surrounded by clouds of smoke.]\nLiftoff[The rocket ascends vertically]\nMax-Q: Peak aerodynamic stress[Separation of the two external booster rockets is shown, with the main rocket continuing to ascend vertically with a slight rightward tilt and the two boosters curving off to the right.]\nBooster separation[The main rocket stage starts to curve over to the right.]\nMax-CB: Highest chance of collision with care bears[Separation of the second rocket stage. Main rocket heads right, whilst second booster stage curves downward to meet trajectory of first booster stages.]\nMain stage separation[Main rocket continues towards the right.]\nGPS silenced so it will stop saying \"make a U-turn\"[First and second stage booster rocket trajectories meet and become a single trajectory heading upwards and right.]\nReunification[Trajectory of main rocket wobbles slightly.]\nPilot panics, copilot takes command after struggle[Booster stage rockets continue to head upwards and right towards the main rocket trajectory.]\nPursuit phase[Main rocket and booster stage trajectories meet and cross three times.]\nInter-stage dogfight[The trajectory for one of the stages ends in an explosion.][The remaining trajectory, indicated with dashed-lines and question marks, continues towards the right and off the edge of the page.]\n Winner proceeds to space"
