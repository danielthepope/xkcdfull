I swear I got her the first time. But now it says the number's wrong.[Zoom in on the friend, Cueball talking to him off-panel.]\nFriend: What did you say she did, again?\nCueball (off-panel): Voice work. At Verizon, I think.\nCueball (off-panel): Why?\nFriend: No reason.[Megan is talking into a phone, in an italic voice. Cueball's remark is shown emanating from the phone with a zig-zag line, also the click from hanging up the phone is shown like that.]\nMegan: We're sorry, your call could not be completed as dialed.\nCueball (over the  phone): Damn.\n*Click*\nMegan: Please check the number and try again."
