She looks toward her off-panel class, from where a voice replies to her question.]\nMiss Lenhart: Given these prevalences, is it likely that the test result is a false positive?\nOff-panel voice: Well, this chapter is on Bayes' Theorem, so yes.[Caption below the panel]:\nSometimes, if you understand Bayes' Theorem well enough, you don't need it."
