  "transcript": "[Cueball finds a computer tower with a wire leading away from it.]\nCueball: What's this?\nOff-screen: The Cloud.[Cueball looks behind him. The wire leads to an outlet in the wall next to where Black Hat sits at a desk with a computer. Another wire leads from that outlet to Black Hat's computer.]\nCueball: Huh? I always thought \"The Cloud\" was a huge, amorphous network of servers somewhere.\nBlack Hat: Yeah, but everyone buys server time from everyone else. In the end, they're all getting it here.[A close-up of Black Hat.]\nCueball: How? You're on a cable modem.\nBlack Hat: There's a lot of caching.[A close-up of Cueball, looking down at the tower at his feet.]\nCueball: Should the cord be stretched across the room like this?\nBlack Hat: Of course. It has to reach the server, and the server is over there.[Cueball turns back to the Black Hat, still sitting at the computer.]\nCueball: What if someone trips on it?\nBlack Hat: Who would want to do that? It sounds unpleasant.\nCueball: Uh. Sometimes people do stuff by accident.\nBlack Hat: I don't think I know anybody like that."
