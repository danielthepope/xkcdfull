It's traveling through the floor and making my desk resonate.\nFriend: Oh, I didn't even realize! I'll stop.\n[Cueball passes a sheet of paper to the friend.]\nCueball: Actually, can you just shift the frequency up by 15%? I think you can get resonance with Steve's desk instead.\nFriend: Uh huh...\nCueball: Here are the calculations. Let's coordinate and try to spill his drink."
