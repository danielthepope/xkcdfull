They have a cup of what appears to be two lovebirds in it.]\nPerson 2: At least it's better than the quail eggs in whipped cream and MSG from last time.\n[Person 3 has a plate with a several lumps of some form of white stuff on it. They have a cup of what appears to be some kind of superfluid flowing out of it.]\nPerson 3: Are these Skittles deep-fried?Cueball: C'mon, guys, be patient.
