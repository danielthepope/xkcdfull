Above the note is a small black frame with Cueballs comment:]\nCueball (off-panel): But I got this note from him:\n[The note:]\nDude\nIn like a month im gonna Craigslist all that shit you left in my garage\nJust FYI\n-Chad[Zoom in on Cueball who lifts both hands palms up.]\nCueball: It's an outrage! This is no way to run a storage business!\nFriend (off-panel): Are you paying him to look after your stuff?[Final frame almost like the first frame, but Cueball has taken his hands down.]\nCueball: No.\nFriend: Then what he runs isn't a storage business.\nCueball: Well, I'm this close to not giving him any more stuff.\nFriend: That'll teach him."
