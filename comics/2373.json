  "transcript": "[Cueball and Ponytail face a table with something like a lab stirrer or heater on it, supporting a flat-bottomed and -topped container from which bubbles are rising.]\nCueball: How will I know if the reaction fails?\nPonytail: You'll smell the sulfides.\nCueball: What do those smell like?\nPonytail: Sulfurous. Rotten eggs.[A new panel, the table is gone. Cueball is now facing Ponytail.]\nCueball: Chemists always compare sulfur to rotten eggs.\nCueball: But why would I know that smell?\nPonytail: I dunno, It's a common thing![Ponytail puts her hand out.]\nCueball: Is it? My kitchen is messy, but there aren't eggs lying around rotting.\nPonytail: You must have smelled one at some point.[Ponytail is now walking right off-panel, away from Cueball. She is clenching her hands and is evidently annoyed]\nCueball: Are all chemists' houses full of random raw eggs? Do you toss them over your shoulder for good luck?\nPonytail: My house is not full of eggs!\nCueball: What do you consider a normal amount of eggs in a house?\nCueball: If kids egg your house this Halloween, how will you know??"
