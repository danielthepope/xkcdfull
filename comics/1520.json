  "transcript": "[Hairy is acting as the host of a TV talk show, Degree-Off holding a microphone up. Cueball, a character who looks like a grown-up Science Girl, and Megan are acting as representatives of physics, biology and chemistry respectively. They each stand behind their own lectern with the respective subject label.]\nHairy: Welcome to the Degree-Off, where we determine which field is the best! Physics, wanna go first?\nCueball (Phys): Sure! I'd like to tell the story of Richard Feynman's Manhattan project lockpicking pranks...\nLabels: Phys Bio Chem [Zoom in so Megan is no longer visible. Cueball lifts his hand]\nCueball (Phys): ...and as he said, \"all science is either physics or stamp collecting.\"\nCueball (Phys): Thank you.\nHairy: Great! Bio, you wanna go next?\nGrown-Up Science Girl (Bio): Okay.\nLabels: Phys Bio[Zoom in on Grown-Up Science Girl so only she and her lectern are shown. A graph is shown above her. There us a label for the y-axis to the left of the axis which has four ticks with numbers. The x-axis is a timeline without ticks but three years indicating the start center and end of the axis. The graph shows a curve falling off, with one great spike up around 1920.]\nY-axis label: Per 100,000\nY-axis:\n800\n600\n400\n200\nX-axis: 1900 1950 2000\nGUSG (Bio): This is a graph of the death rate from infectious disease in this country.\nLabels: Bio[Zoom back to original scene with Hairy holding the microphone down and Grown-Up Science Girl raising her left hand, while Cueball looks at her.]\nGUSG (Bio): The heroes of my field have slain one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse.\nLabels: Phys Bio Chem [Zoom in on only Cueball and Grown-Up Science Girl who is pointing aggressively at Cueball who leans away from her one hand on his lectern for support.]\nGUSG (Bio): While the heroes of your field gathered in the desert to create a new one.\nLabels: Phys Bio[Zoom back to previous scene all are holding their hands down.]\nCueball (Phys): ...Jeez, what the hell? I thought this was supposed to be fun and lighthearted!\nGUSG (Bio): You must have been thinking of stamp collecting.\nLabels: Phys Bio Chem "
