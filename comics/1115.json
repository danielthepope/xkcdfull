  "transcript": "[Megan is looking down at Beret Guy, who appears to be doing a handstand on a grass lawn, with grass tuft drawn several places, including where his hands touch the grass. His hands can be seen in the grass like he is holding on to the grass. Both his legs are moving around above him, as indicated by movement lines.]\nMegan: What are you doing?\nBeret Guy: Clinging to the ceiling of a bottomless abyss.[Megan walks past Beret Guy, whose legs are still moving. She is still looking down at the grass.]\nMegan: You are very odd.[In a frame-less panel, Megan walks towards a mailbox looking down at it. There is grass around the base of the mailbox pole.][As Megan passes the mailbox, she looks up towards the sky and seems to stop.][The last panel is upside down with the grass at the top and the mailbox pointing down. Megan is clinging to the mailbox, sitting on the grass with her head under the mailbox. Ponytail approaches her, walking on the grass with her head pointing down. The text is written in the sky below them.]\nPonytail: What's wrong?\nMegan: I looked down."
