  "transcript": "[Cueball approaches his desktop computer, which has emitted a message seemingly from White Hat as it displays a picture of him.]\nNew chat message[Below the chat log is shown with White Hat's comments on the left in gray frames and Cueball's comments to the right in white frames. The first post in a row from each person is labeled with their picture at the end of a small arrow in the frame]:\nWhite Hat: Can't sleep. Stupid dog keeps barking.\nWhite Hat: So frustrating. FJAFJKLDSKF7JKFDJ\nCueball: Ugh, I'm sorry. Maybe you could...\nCueball: ... Okay, wait. I have to ask.\nCueball: How did you hit a \"7\" in the middle there?\nWhite Hat: Huh?\nWhite Hat: I was just randomly keyboard mashing.\nCueball: Sorry, Right.\nWhite Hat: Anyway,\nCueball: I know this is silly, but like... All your hands were clearly right on the home row.\nCueball: I don't get how one finger could have stretched up to the \"7\".\nWhite Hat: Why do you always fixate on these bizarre details?\nCueball: I don't know.\nCueball: Sorry.\nWhite Hat: It's weird, is all.[Chat transcript continues above White Hat's laptop, as it started in the first panel over Cueball's computer. But now we see a human-sized spider suspended from the ceiling by web is using three of its legs to type on the laptop. Behind the spider, White Hat is suspended from the ceiling upside down, almost totally encased in spider web. He tries to speak. Between them, a chair has been knocked over onto its back.]\nSpider (as White Hat in the chat): I am a normal human typing with my human hands.\nCueball (chat): Yeah, of course. I know.\nWhite Hat (speaking): Mmm!! Mmph!!!"
