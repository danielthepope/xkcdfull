  "transcript": "[White Hat talks to two children sitting in front of him on the floor to the right. A boy with hair like Hairy with his arms round his knees and behind him Science Girl with two hair buns, sitting cross leged on her knees. Megan interrupts him from off-panel right.]\nWhite Hat: Everyone said the world was flat, but Columbus knew it was round.\nMegan (off-panel): *Sigh* no, no, no.[Megan walks in holding a hand palm up. White Hat partly lifts his arm closest to her. The children between them turn their heads towards her. The boy leans back on one hand.]\nMegan: So he took his ships and sailed west—\nMegan: —in a line tangent to the surface. The sea fell away, and he landed in Valinor.[White Hat has taken his arm down, Megan holds her arms out to each side. The children still looks at her, now also Science Girl leans back on one arm.]\nMegan: A Silmaril on his brow, he wanders the heavens as the morning star, still believing he reached India.\nWhite Hat: Stop making stuff up.\nMegan: You first."
