If it didn't exist, it would sound totally implausible.\nCueball: Seriously.[Ponytail and Cueball continue walking to the right.]\nCueball: Do you ever worry about how reliant we are on systems that someone happens to maintain for some reason but which could disappear at any time?[Ponytail and Cueball are seen in silhouette from a distance.]\nPonytail: Yeah - the same thing freaks me out about having a body.\nCueball: I know, right?? I don't even know what half these parts do!\nPonytail: And yet if they stop, we die!\nCueball: Probably best not to think about it."
