Yesterday and today are labeled in time, 0 and 1 in number of husbands. Points are plotted with 0 at yesterday, 1 at today. A straight line is fitted through them.]\n[Cueball is holding a pointer to the graph, and looking at Megan wearing a dress and veil.]\nCueball: As you can see, by late next month you'll have over four dozen husbands.\nCueball: Better get a bulk rate on wedding cake."
