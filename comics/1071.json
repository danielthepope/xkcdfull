  "transcript": "[An large diagram of dots, mostly of varying shades of brown and greenish yellow, with a number of smaller blue dots, tiny green dots and some larger red dots. At the top of the circle are five lines of text in very different font size.]\nAll 786 known\nplanets\n(as of June 2012)\nto scale\n(Some planet sizes estimated based on mass.)[Below this text is a small section of 8 planets which are framed in a light gray frame with lighter gray background . It is situated right below the above text with only a few planets in between the text and the frame. These planets include two large yellow, two smaller blue two small green and two tiny green planets. A line goes between this frame to another frame with the first word in the text below, that is in a similar frame. The rest of the text follows to the right and then below this first word covering the central part of the circle from just around the center of the circle and a bit below.]\nThis  is our solar system. \nThe rest of these orbit other stars and were only discovered recently. \nMost of them are huge because those are the kind we learned to detect first, but now we're finding that small ones are actually more common. \nWe know nothing about what's on any of them. With better telescopes, that could change. \nThis is an exciting time."
