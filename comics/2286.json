Also indicated is the width of the full \"6' zone\", which consists of 6' to her right, her width, and 6' to her left. Her width is not explicitly indicated.][Overhead image of a person within a slightly elliptical outline at a distance of 6 feet in all directions. The \"width\" of the person pushes the ellipse longer in one dimension. The ellipse is again labeled \"6' zone\".][Statistics:]\nApprox. area: 145 ft2\nBorder length: 43 ft\nPopulation density: 190,000 people/mile2\nValue at NYC real estate price/ft2: $195,000\nMaximum number of horses that could fit inside it with you, estimated using the dimensions in the US Forest Service Equestrian Design Handbook: 8[This last statistic is illustrated with a second overhead image, showing 8 horses, mosaicked together a little like an M.C.
