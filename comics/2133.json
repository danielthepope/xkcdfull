  "transcript": "[Cueball is standing behind a lectern, with \"Press Conference\" and the EHT logo displayed on a projector screen behind him.]\nCueball: We linked up our observatories, got everything aligned, and there it was:\nCueball: The first image of a black hole![Zoom in on Cueball. A question is asked from off panel.]\nOff-panel question: Can you share the picture?\nCueball: Well, here's the thing...[Cueball lifts his arm holding his hand with its palm up.]\nCueball: Turns out our telescope feed is like Pinterest, where you can't right-click to save an image.\nCueball: So we tried to take a screenshot, but the key combination kept turning off the display instead.[Zoom back out to show that the image on the projector screen has changed to show a blurry picture of a white computer screen against a black background. The EHT logo remains at the bottom of the projector screen.]\nCueball: I grabbed my phone and tried to take a picture of the screen, but I was too slow. The observation had ended.\nCueball: We're planning to try again next year, and we'll definitely record the screen this time."
