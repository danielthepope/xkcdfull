I've known you for so long that I'd have to spend years with someone to build up this kind of connection and I daren't let you go of you long enough to let that happen.\nMegan: But I guess this is really all I can ask for. I'm happy with you; I should stop worrying.\n[Megan takes Hairy's hand.]\nHairy: This is probably a bad time to bring this up, but I don't actually like you."
