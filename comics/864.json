I want my flying car.\nMegan (over the phone): Dude.[In a frame-less panel Megan, looking left, is talking with Cueball over her phone, which she holds up to her left cheek.]\nMegan: You're complaining to me using a phone on which you buy and read books,[Zoom in on topless Megan as she takes the phone down in front of her looking at it and talking to it.]\nMegan: And which you were using to play a 3D shooter until I interrupted you with what would be a video call if I were wearing a shirt.[Cueball is now also looking down at his phone held in front of him, talking to it. Again the reply from Megan is shown to come from the phone with a zigzag line.]\nCueball: Can't I have a flying car, too?\nMegan (over the phone): You'd crash it while texting and playing Angry Birds."
