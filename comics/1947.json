It feels like everyone I know is yelling all the time.[Frame is zoomed out. Stars are visible in the sky.]\nMegan: That's why it's so nice to unplug. Leave the phones at home, go for a walk, and look up at the stars.\nMegan: It helps you focus on what really matters.[Frame is zoomed in again.]\nCueball: Like \"Where the hell are we?\"\nMegan: And \"Why did I leave my phone at home? It has my map and flashlight.\"\nCueball: \"Are there mountain lions around here? Did you hear a twig break?\"\nMegan: Yeah, the big questions!"
