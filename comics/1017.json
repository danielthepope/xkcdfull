  "transcript": "When I have a boring task to get through — a three-hour lecture, a giant file download, or a long term point goal in fitocracy — I use this formula to convert the percentage completed (p) into a date:T=(Current Date) - (e^(20.3444*p^3+3) - e^3) yearsWhen the task is 0% done, it gives today's date, and as I make progress, I move further and further back in time(inverse given in lighter colors)\nInverse: p = sqrt((ln(T+e^3)-3)/20.3444)[Line Graph explaining the correlation between completion percentages and temporal deltas.\n0% = now (Date of comic is 2012-02-14T00:00-0500, approx. 1329195600 UNIX)\n10% = September 2011\n20% = 2008\n30% = 1997\n40% = 1958\n50% = 1776\n60% = 405 AD\n70% = 22,000 years ago\n80% = 671,000 years ago\n90% = 55 million years ago\n100% = 13.8 billion years ago\n]It moves slowly through the first few years, then steadily accelerates. I tuned the formula so the time spent in each part of the past is loosely proportional to how well I know it. This means I hit familiar landmarks with each bit of progress, giving me a satisfying sense of movement.[The following are panels detailing completion percentages, correlated time periods, and notable events from this time period.]7.308% December 18, 2011\nAround this time:\nKim Jong-Il dies. US leaves Iraq.31.12% February 1995\nAround this time:\nWindows 95 debuts.

Watching all that time blur past is such a rush!\nMegan: So...you've tried to make an extreme sport out of...waiting.\nCueball: Swoosh!"
