  "transcript": "[Megan sits on an office chair at a desk. A laptop computer is on the desk, audio from a Cleverbot chat is shown coming from the laptop with a zigzag line from the screen. Megan has turned her head away from the computer to the right addressing Cueball off-panel.]\nMegan: Did you see the Cleverbot-Cleverbot chat?\nCleverbot (from computer): I am not a robot. I'm a unicorn.[In the next frame-less panel, Megan has turned the chair away from the desk, which is not shown, and is now sitting with her hands in her lap in front of Cueball who holds one hand up as he replies.]\nCueball: Yeah. It's hilarious, but it's just clumsily sampling a huge database of lines people have typed. Chatterbots still have a long way to go.[A close-up of Megan's head and shoulders. She has a hand to her chin and appears to be contemplating the last remark. Cueball replies from off-panel.]\nMegan: So... Computers have mastered playing chess and driving cars across the desert, but can't hold five minutes of normal conversation?\nCueball (off-panel): Pretty much.[Both are shown again as in panel two, Cueball with his hands down.]\nMegan: Is it just me, or have we created a Burning Man attendee?"
