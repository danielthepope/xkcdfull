  "transcript": "[White Hat holding one hand up in front om him and Megan are walking together.]\nWhite Hat: In Jurassic World, we've used genetic engineering to create a better dinosaur.\nMegan: Tyrannosaurus is the most charismatic animal that ever lived, and you think you'll upstage it?[White Hat now holds both his hands up in front of him as he and Megan walk on.]\nWhite Hat: Tyrannosaurus was cool, but it's two decades old!\nMegan: I think it's a little older than that.[In this frame-less panel White Hat points up as they continue to walk.]\nWhite Hat: We took Tyrannosaurus and we improved it. Made it scarier, deadlier, smarter.\nWhite Hat: Lookâ€“there it is![White Hat (drawn without his hat) and Megan are dwarfed in the bottom left corner as they stare up at a facsimile of the green T-Rex from Dinosaur Comics. They only reach T-Rex to it's knees.]"
