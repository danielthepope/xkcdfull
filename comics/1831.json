Cueball walks in from the right.]\nMegan: Our field has been struggling with this problem for years.[Cueball holds his laptop high up in one arm above Megan's head while holding his other arm out as well. Megan has turned to look at him.]\nCueball: Struggle no more! I'm here to solve it with algorithms![In a frame-less panel Cueball sits on a chair at a desk with his laptop working on it, while Hairy and Megan looks on from behind.][Cueball, still sitting at his laptop, points at the screen.
