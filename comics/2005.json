I have no attention span anymore.[Zoom in on the faces of Cueball and Megan.]\nMegan: Didn't you literally just spend six hours obsessively reading about the theory that Thomas the Tank Engine is authoritarian propaganda depicting a post-apocalyptic fascist dystopia?[Cueball still standing there. Megan begins pacing away.]\nCueball: OK\nCueball: I mean I have no attention span for anything good anymore.\nMegan: Let's check out your bookshelf, shall we?[Cueball alone.]\nCueball: What are you-\nOff-panel: I see a dragon holding a sword in its teeth on the cover of a book that's thicker than it is wide.\nCueball: And? That's a classic!\nOff-panel: Just saying, I don't think this is a new development."
