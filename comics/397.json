On this episode, we'll find out!\nCueball: Mmm, science.\nMegan: Hey, Mythbusters is entertaining, but it's not science.Zombie Feynman: BRAAAAAIIINNS...\nCueball: Zombie Feynman!\nZombie Feynman: You got a problem with Mythbusters?\nMegan: They fail at basic rigor!Zombie Feynman: \"Ideas are tested by experiment.\" That is the core of science. Everything else is bookkeeping.Zombie Feynman: By teaching people to hold their beliefs up to experiment, Mythbusters is doing more to drag humanity out of the unscientific darkness than a thousand lessons in rigor. Show them some love.Zombie Feynman: Anyway, back to zombie stuff. I hunger for BRAAAAAIIINNS!\nCueball: Uh, try the physics lab next door.\nZombie Feynman: I said brains. All they've got are string theorists."
