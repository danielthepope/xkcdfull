The big stores are DRM free.[Zoom in on Megan who holds up a hand doing the sign of the horns.]\nMegan: So close the comment thread, get out the debit card, buy us some music, and let's rock the fuck out.[Back to viewing both as in panel 2.]\nCueball: But I don't actually like music, I just like being self-righteous on the web.\nMegan: Lucky for you, that will always be free."
