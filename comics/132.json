  "transcript": "[Megan and Cueball converse.]\nMegan: What kind of music do you listen to?\nCueball: Oh, a mix of things. Some classic rock like Boston, but then of course Queen and Bowie, Joan Jett...\nMegan: Definitely, we need more of those sounds.\nCueball: But there's some great newer stuff too, like Franz Ferdinand, The Donnas, and Audioslave.\nMegan: Sometimes they're a little much for me. I go more for things like The Arcade Fire, sometimes mixing some electronic sounds like Postal Service.\nCueball: Oh yeahâ€”have you ever checked out Freezepop?\nMegan: Mhm! Synth pop can be fun, but at the same time, I agree that sometimes you just need to blast some Metallica.\nCueball: Who?\nMegan: ...Metallica.\nCueball: Are they new?\nI sound pretty knowledgeable about music until people figure out that I'm just naming bands from Guitar Hero."
