  "transcript": "[Two Cueball-like guys stand together as a young guy dressed up with small ears and a tail approaches.]\nCueball: Oh God, a furry. Don't let it touch you.[The furry hears someone call out to him.]\nOff-screen: Hey, kid.[Megan is seen preparing a kite to be flown.]\nMegan: Forget those assholes. Come help me.[The furry begins to help Megan set up the kite.]\nFurry: Thanks. So you're cool with furries?[The two are now standing far appart the furry with the kite and the line going over to Megan.]\nMegan: Well, I think your fetish is weird as hell. It just bothers me how you're this designated Internet punching bag among people who are otherwise down with weird fetishes. So I stick up for you when I can.[The kite now successfully up in the air and Megan pulls the line with both hands moving backwards.]\nFurry: Well, thanks. I owe you one.\nMegan: It's no big deal.[Megan stops some distance from the fury holding the line with one hhand. The fury lift one hand up apologising.]\nFurry: No, this is like the lion and the mouse.\nMegan: ...Listen, can we pick a comparison less likely to turn you on?\nFurry: Sorry."
