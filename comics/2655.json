  "transcript": "[There is a light gray caption written above two normal text captions that are above two panels:]\nFor the last few years, I've been working on answering peoples' ridiculous questions for What If? 2, which sometimes meant asking scientists for help.[Caption above the left panel:]\nHow you'd expect scientists to respond to ridiculous questions:[Cueball, representing Randall, stands holding a pad and pencil in front of a desk. There are a stack of three books and some papers on the desk. Hairbun is sitting on an office chair behind the desk. She is pointing at Cueball.]\nHairbun: Why would you present me with this frivolous scenario?\nHairbun: Such an absurd query can serve no practical purpose.\nHairbun: Now go; you distract me from my formulas.[Caption above the right panel:]\nHow they actually respond:[Same setting as in the left panel but the items on the desk have changed, so there are now a laptop computer and a stack with a book and some papers on the desk. Hairbun is sitting on an office chair behind the desk. She is holding another stack of papers up in both hands.]\nHairbun: Oh thank God, something fun to think about that's not grant applications.\nHairbun: Hey, do you want to fill out some grant applications? I'll give you literally anything. Coauthor credit. Powerful magnets. Do you want plutonium? I can get you plutonium.\nHairbun: What was your name again?[Light gray caption below the panels:]\nTo see the answers I found, preorder at xkcd.com/whatif2 (out 9/13)"
