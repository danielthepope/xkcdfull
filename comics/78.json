  "transcript": "I want to see something unexpected in comics. Just one strip could make up for it all.\n[Garfield is standing on hind legs facing and looking directly at the camera. But is off-center in the frame, about 1/3 from the left, rotated very slightly clockwise.]\n[Zoom in on Garfield, still to the left, now rotated slightly counterclockwise.]\n[Zoom in again on Garfield, now the frame clips off the left side of his face.]\nGarfield thought bubble: The world is burning.\n[Final zoom in, the frame is ripped like a page, offset, and Garfield's eyes are half closed on the right half.]\nGarfield thought bubble: Run.\nJim Davis, throw off your commercial shackles. Challenge us. Go out in a blaze of Dadaist glory. There is still time."
