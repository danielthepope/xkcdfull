There is a title below the feed.]\nCueball: We go live to our 2013: Year in Review!\nMegan: Thanks! \nMegan: In 2013, I didn't see an aurora.\nCueball: I- what?\nTitle: Year in Review[Zoom to the top part of the screen with Megan. Her text is written above the screen without a frame around this segment of the comic.]\nMegan: The northern lights. I thought this would finally be the year. \nMegan: But it didn't happen.[Back to the original view but Cueball has turned more towards Megan, with only one arm on the desk.]\nCueball: Oh. Uh... What about the rest of the year?\nMegan: What do you mean?\nCueball: Any big news stories?\nMegan: Oh yeah, tons.\nTitle: Year in Review[Same setting but Megan turns away from Cueball, who has taken both hands of the table. Megan is looking to her left at something off screen. Beat panel.]\nTitle: Year in Review[Cueball turns back to face the viewers, both hands back on the desk, as Megan is leaving the screen, walking out to the right, her face already hidden by the frame of the feed.]\nCueball: ...Well, that was 2013: Year in Review.\nMegan: The sky's clearing up. I'll be outside.\nTitle: Year in Review"
