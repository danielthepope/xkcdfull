  "transcript": "[Cueball is standing, holding a trowel, in a vague outdoor area. Beret Guy is kneeling, one hand on the ground, as he carefully pours the contents of a small bag into a hole in the ground with the other.]\nCueball: Thanks for the gardening help!\nBeret Guy: I made these seeds myself![Beret Guy is now standing next to a small eruption coming from the ground.][Beret Guy looks down on a knee-high volcano in full eruption. It produces a large plume above and smaller clouds above that, which are mainly drifting away from Beret Guy. Lava flows down from the top of the volcano.]\nBeret Guy: The infusion of nutrient-rich volcanic soil will revitalize your garden.[Beret Guy spread his arms out to the sides as he looks at the now waist-high volcano. The plume is much bigger, more lava is flowing from the top and there are flames on its sides. Cueball speaks from off-panel.]\nCueball (off-panel): All my plants are on fire.\nBeret Guy: But soon, life will return to these slopes!"
