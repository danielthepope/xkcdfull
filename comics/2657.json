  "transcript": "[A diagram shows the extrusion of the trapezoidal IPA vowel chart upwards into three dimensions. A point near the center is labeled with an equation that shows \"ə + ½√-1 \" as being equivalent to a made-up symbol that looks like two schwas mirroring each other with other markings above and below.][Below the diagram, a character with shoulder-length dark wavy hair pronounces the new vowel in a speech bubble with unstable lines surrounding it. Two bystanders to her right are bent over slightly, clutching their heads in apparent anguish.][Caption below the panel:]\nLinguistics tip: Extend the IPA vowel plane along the imaginary axis to produce the complex vowels, cursed sounds which the human mind cannot comprehend."
