Megan stands behind him.]Cueball: Keys on my keyboard keep failing, even when I boot from an external recovery disk.\nMegan: Sounds like it's hardware, then.[Cueball moves over to the laptop behind him.]Cueball: Yeah... except the problem followed me from my last computer.\nMegan: You have the most bizarre tech issues.[Cueball picks up the keyboard from the rear computer and plugs it into the one in front of him.]Cueball: It must be spreading via keyboards. This one won't work with any computer now.\nMegan: When the robot apocalypse happens, I'm hiding out in your house. Any Skynet drones that come near will develop inexplicable firmware problems and crash."
