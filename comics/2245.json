  "transcript": "[Cueball and Megan are sitting on opposite sides of a leafless tree. They are silhouetted.]\nCueball: I don't get how Edible Arrangements is a thing.[Zoomed in on Cueball and Megan leaning against the tree]\nMegan: That's easy â€” picking out presents is hard and fruit is delicious.\nCueball: Yeah, true.[Megan gestures with an open hand]\nMegan: But my question is, why did they call it \"Edible Arrangements\" and not \"Vore of the Roses\"?[Pan to just Megan. Megan turns to face Cueball]\nCueball: Just for that, I'm going to cancel the one I got you.\nMegan: Nooo! I want my Mouth Blossoms! \nMegan: My Juicy Bouquet! My Oral Floral! \nMegan: Hey, come back!"
