The caption is written first for each panel. In the first panel Cueball has unpacked a hose. The paper lies in tatters on the floor. Megan stands next to him.]\nDay 1: Length of rubber hose\nCueball: Could be handy around the house.[Cueball stands with a black item and the torn paper it came in. Megan looks on.]\nDay 2: Ski mask\nCueball: It's spring, but hey.[Cueball is standing alone with a bear trap and the box it came in on the floor.]\nDay 3: Bear trap\nCueball: Huh.[Megan is back as Cueball looks at a piece of paper that came in an envelope.]\nDay 4: Tourist map of the Pentagon.\nMegan: Uh oh.[Cueball is standing alone with a bottle of lube in one hand and the box it came in in the other hand.]\nDay 5: Lube\nCueball: I'm stopping this before I end up on every F.B.I. watch list ever."
