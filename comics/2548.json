  "transcript": "[Cueball and Megan are having a conversation while walking.]\nCueball: The Internet makes it easy to be a jerk and forget the person we're talking to is a human.\nMegan: Yeah...\nMegan: But it also makes us see messages from awful people and assume they come from normal peers.[Closeup on Megan. Above Megan is a picture of a \"reply\" post from a man with sunglasses. The post has a title above it.]\nMegan: Recently I got a mean reply from a stranger. It was minor but it really got to me.\nPost title: Replies to \"Favorite Movie\"\nPost: Every group has one person who likes that movie, and it's the friend they all secretly hate.[Blondie as a news anchor behind a desk. There is a picture of the man with sunglasses with \"Arrested\" under his name. His picture is next to a picture of a house with \"Breaking\" above it. Megan's dialogue appears above the picture, but she herself is not shown in this panel.]\nMegan: Then the next week I saw that guy on the news. He was an actual murderer![Megan and Cueball standing next to each other.]\nMegan: I can't believe I spent a week stressed out that my taste in movies wasn't shared by the East Valley Strangler.\nCueball: Yeah, at least wait for a second opinion from the Lake Slayer."
