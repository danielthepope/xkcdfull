  "transcript": "[A graph is shown. The x-axis is labeled \"Cat size\" and the y-axis, \"Cat cuteness\". Parallel to and a short distance from the y axis is a dashed line the same length as the y-axis line, representing a vertical asymptote; the space between the y axis and the dashed line is labelled \"Critical Limit\". Graphed is a function coming down from infinity, starting close to the dashed line; it then levels off and does not reach zero on-screen. At the top end of the graph is the text \"Schwarzschild's Cat\" and an arrow pointing upwards outside of the graph.]"
