  "transcript": "[A graph with time on the x-axis and items Randall replaced with his smartphone on the y-axis. For each item, the time he (allegedly) replaced it is marked; the marks form a jagged line down the graph, roughly sorted by when he switched. The regions are marked]\n I have a specific device for this\n[and]\n I just use my phone\n [items where the switch-over date is in the past:]\n Telephone\n Web Browser\n Camera\n Newspaper\n Flashlight\n TV Remote\n Credit Card\n Car Key\n[items where the switch-over date is in the future:]\n Dog Leash\n Steering Wheel\n Band-Aid\n Cheese Grater\n Stapler\n Nail Clipper\n Electric Drill\n Toothbrush[The x-axis (time) shows at point labelled as 'now' roughly halfway along the graph, a grey dashed line runs vertically down the whole graph. Car Keys have just been replaced by a phone, all other items listed below that have yet to be replaced. For the most part the gradient of the trend is constant at around -1. The last item (Toothbrush) is replaced before the penultimate item (Electric Drill)]"
