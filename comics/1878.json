  "transcript": "[An orbital map of the Earth is shown. The Sun is in the center, the Earth is at the right bottom, and the Moon is left below the Earth.]\nWhy isn't there an eclipse every month?\nThis is a common question! The answer is made clear by a quick look at the Earth's orbital diagram:[Label Sun:]\nSolar plexus[Label on the Earth's plane:]\nSagittal plane[Labels on Earth's orbit (beginning at the Earth counterclockwise):]\nPerihelix, Declension, Obsequity, Hypothecate, Enceliopsis, Equinox (Solstice in British English)[Two angles in the plane are labeled as:]\nDeterminant of the date of Easter, Arctangent[The plane of the Moon is pictured in a small angle to the Earth's plane and named Astral Plane. The angle is presented between two lines (Greek Nu or Gamma and a double Greek Chi) and identified by a character that looks similar to a Greek Phi but with two vertical lines.]\n[The labels at the Moon's path are:]\nTropopause, Prolapse, Errata.[An arrow points to the Earth at the zero meridian on the equator. The label reads:]\nDimples of Venus"
