    [A stick figure is standing, hands over head. A velociraptor is running
    towards it.]

    1. The velociraptor spots you 40 meters away and attacks, accelerating at 4
    m/s^2 to its top speed of 25 m/s. When it spots you, you begin to flee,
    quickly reaching your top speed of 6 m/s. How far can you get before you're
    caught and devoured?

    2. You're at the center of a 20m equilateral triangle with a raptor at each
    corner. The top raptor has a wounded leg and is limited to a top speed of 10
    m/s.

    [A stick figure is shown in the above situation. The picture has a legend
    "(Not to scale)".]

    The raptors will run toward you. At what angle should you run to maximize
    the time you stay alive?

    3. Raptors can open doors, but they are slowed by them. Using the floor plan
    on the next page, plot a route through the building, assuming raptors take 5
    minutes to open the first door and halve the time for each subsequent door.
    Remember, raptors run at 10 m/s and they do not know fear.

    moment smoothly following the gentle curves of societal norms. We act like
    if we just get through today, tomorrow our dreams will come back to us.

    Cueball: And no, I don't have all the answers. I don't know how to jolt
    myself into seeing what each moment could become. But I do know one thing:
    the solution doesn't involve watering down my every little idea and creative
    impulse for the sake of some day easing my fit into a mold. It doesn't
    involve tempering my life to better fit someone's expectations. It doesn't
    involve constantly holding back for fear of shaking things up.

    and the speech is in bubbles rather than just indicated with a thin line
    from the speaker. This is true for all spoken text. Also Beef almost never
    uses any punctuation in his sentences.]

    [Philippe, an anthropomorphic stuffed otter, is participating in a hearing
    aid test with headphones over his ears, and one arm raised. He is at a
    doctor and behind him on the wall There is an eye chart with six lines of
    E's, the large one on top a regular E, and then in the next two lines they
    are turned around in the four general directions. The last three lines are
    not readable. The doctor talks to Philippe from off-panel in a bubble going
    to the far right. Here it meets a thought bubble line going down and left
    from the upper right corner. On the right side the back ground is gray and
    Philippe can be seen lying in a bed, dreaming the scene to the left.]

    front of him with both hands. They are seen from the waist up. Most of the
    time below, their eyebrows are visible to show feelings, but Beef's is not
    shown here. When they speak their mouths are open, else it is closed. Beefs
    is closed in this panel. Above the drawing there is a line and in the thin
    frame formed by that and the top panel there is a caption:]

    Meanwhile . . .

    Ray: Beef, check this out. I got an invite to that The Dude Is Pretty
    Awesome In Most Measurable Ways I Mean Wow competition.

    [This panel pans up so less of their bodies can be seen, and more text be
    above them. It is clear that Ray has a medal hanging around his neck, which
    was partly covered by his hands in the previous panel, which are now down.
    Apart from this they look the same.]

    Beef: Alright that is pretty sweet dogg what is your strategy gonna consist
    of

    Ray: I'm thinkin' I need to point out my best features -- maybe go holdin' a
    sign with an arrow toward my junk.

    [Ray is seen almost in full figure, which reveals that he is only wearing
    big black underpants and the medal, his nipples are also clearly visible on
    each side of the medal (as they were already in the previous panel, but not
    the one before). He has one arm in his side, the other holding a large sign
    with big bold text and beneath this a large black arrow pointing first down
    and then across towards his pants waistband.]

    Sign: Yes

    [Back to same view as in the first panel, except a pan so Ray is in the
    center and Beef is partly cut off at the left frame so there is space for a
    speech bubble to the right of Ray. Ray holds up a drink glass in front of
    him with a cherry in the bottom. Beefs eyebrows are missing.]

    Beef: Yeah well I always said subtlety was your middle name dogg

    Beef: And also your first and last in case they didn't get the point

    Ray: How do you think I should play it?

    [Only Beef is shown in this panel to make room for his speech bubbles.]

    Beef: Well basically you got no chance as I see it these dudes are all
    lovers and fighters to the last

    Beef: All sprung fully formed from the head of Sweet Sweetback

    Beef: You are gonna stand out as the sort of dude who stays at home all

    Beef: Uh huh about the fight I wasn't gonna tell you but how could you miss
    that I was setting you up

    end.

    [Silence 1. Both are shown from the waistline and up standing looking
    slightly down, arms down. Rays has closed his mouth. Generally their ears
    shift a bit from panel to panel the rest of the way, and also their head
    position. But else they stay the same distance from each other.]

    They do not reappear in the rest of the comic indicating he keeps his eyes
    downcast. ]

    [Silence 6. Same view. Beefs eyebrows are back]

    [Silence 7. The view has panned so low that it is possible to see the
    waistband of Ray's underpants. Beef is looking even more down and has moved
    closer to Ray who's mouth is open again.]

    [Silence 8. Same view, but a little less waistband visible. Beef has moved
    back again his eyebrows are missing and his mouth are open, and Ray looks
    even more down than before still mouth open.]

    buttons and indicators, and the red head on top of two gray sticks, has two
    video cameras for eyes. It is shown standing in a lab with a green brick
    wall behind it. It stands beneath a poster with text and a piece of paper
    taped to the wall with unreadable text, but only the first line of text can
    be seen on these as the first of the two white text areas in the panel
    covers the rest. To the right there is a blue table with a computer screen,
    (most of it visible but it is cut of at the right panel), with blue
    background and three overlapping windows - unreadable text in the first
    window, some graphics in the second window and only white in the last
    window. Two black items (one looks like a pen) lies on the table to the
    left, and beneath the table is a shelve where the keyboard lies. A wire goes
    from the robot to the computer. The other white text box is beneath the
    computer table partly obscuring the lower part of the robot as well.]

    [T-Rex, a large green Tyrannosaurus, holds out his small arms to each side
    and the tail pointing up while speaking with wide open pink mouth showing
    all his teeth. All the text is written like on a typewriter with both caps
    and lowercase letters, which is not normal in xkcd.]

    T-Rex: THINGS I AM UPPITY ABOUT: "They" as a third-person singular
    gender-free pronoun.

    [Zoom in on T-Rex head holding his hands up under his mouth, and mouth even
    wider open so also the red tongue can be seen.]

    T-Rex: I'm all for it!

    [Zoom out to show T-Rex to the left, mouth almost closed, arms in normal
    position, the tail pointing up and lifting his left leg ready to smash his
    foot down through the roof of a brown log cabin with chimney and porch with
    a blue car holding in front of the house to the right. Further right is a
    smaller white/yellow dinosaur, Dromiceiomimus, standing away from T-Rex, but
    turning itøs long neck toward him.]

    Dromiceiomimus: But isn't that terrible grammar?

    T-Rex: Only by recent convention!  It's been in use that way for centuries,
    and its use is widely accepted!  ALSO: This lets us avoid ridiculous
    constructs like "he/she", "s/he", "xe" or "hirs"!

    [T-Rex is moving left, so part of his head and his lifted right foot is
    outside the panels frame, pink mouth again partly open so tongue can be
    seen, but no teeth are drawn. Arms are still in normal position and the tail
    is pointing up. Beneath the part of his right foot visible, there is Cueball
    about to be squashed. Behind him am orange dinosaur, Utahraptor, has
    appeared. It looks like a smaller version of T-Rex but with longer arms and
    very large claws on it's rear legs. It has it's pink mouth wide open to show
    it's red tongue and teeth, also holding arm in front of it and the tail
    pointing up. It is moving forward standing only on one leg, the other lifted
    high up.]

    Utahraptor: T-Rex, I . . . agree.

    T-Rex: What?

    Utahraptor: That sounds good to me!

    [T-Rex stand with both legs down, but wide spread out. The tails is almost
    down to the ground, only the tip pointing up. The arms are still in front of
    it towards left, but it has turned it's head, mouth almost closed, toward
    right looking at Utahraptor which now stands on both legs, but like it is
    leaning forward on it's toes, stretching up with arms held high, mouth less
    open, but tongue and teeth visible.]

    Utahraptor: Normally I'd jump in with an objection, but I think your point
    makes sense.

    T-Rex: Could it be that the rift in our author's mind has finally healed? Is
    he no longer locked in perpetual war with the self-doubt that lurks in his
    subc-

    [The final part of the final words from T-Rex is interrupted in the previous
    panel and first finishes here after a narrator "speaks" before T-Rex with
    bold capital letters to the top right, and after to the bottom left. T-Rex
    is seen in full figure standing with wide open mouth, teeth and tongue
    visible, arms and tail up.]

    Narrator: IN A WORLD WHERE THERE IS STILL A LAND BRIDGE BETWEEN ASIA AND
    NORTH AMERICA FOR SOME REASON:

    T-Rex: -onscious?

    Narrator: ALSO HOW ABOUT IN THIS WORLD EVERYONE IS BICURIOUS

    I can't do this. I can't parody Penny Arcade. I've got nothing on those

    they're doing. Gabe experiments with his art, always bold and fresh without
    trying to perform. Tycho's writing continues to astound day after day. I can
    just see him, reading my uncultured swill masquerading as his florid prose.

    But he's not angry, no. He's sitting at his desk smiling that condescending
    half-smile, the corner of his mouth belying the self-assurance of a writer
    who never misplaces a word. His firm hands rest easily on the keyboard, his
    right thumb caressing the space bar gently, as I enter the room. He knows
    I'm there without turning around, and I'm too nervous to speak. But I don't
    have to; he understands, I can see it in the way his eyes play over me,
    reading my fears and doubts in a glance and washing them away with a knowing
    smile. Then he's on his feet, he's in front of me, and I don't feel the
    electric jolt I expected as our hands meet. It's just warm, warm and right:
    As I sink into his eyes I feel a hand on my shoulder, and I see Tycho smile
    at someone behind me. Gabe is standing there, grinning that mischievous
    grin, and twirling his beloved cardboard tube between his fingers.

    to argue. It doesn't matter who wins the debate — it's about reality. By
    just waiting a little longer, we'll get to see who was right. It feels
    unethical but I find myself wanting to keep quiet about the science just to
    know for sure. As terrible as it sounds, the state of the world isn't really
    my responsibility. I'm just thrilled to get to watch. If the scientists are
    right — and if we keep people from understanding just a little longer —
    we'll enjoy quite a ride. And pragmatically, on the outside chance that
    they're all wrong, I get saved the embarrassment of having spoken up.

    "Straight cast" starts at zero for an all male cast, peaks at 50/50 cast

    [The first panel has the second panel inside it. It also has a slightly
    light gray background color. Just above the inlaid second panel is Richard
    Stallman lying in his bed sleeping, the bottom part at the foot of the bed
    is hidden behind the second panel below. Below his bed under his head lies a
    katana sword in it's sheath, and another one hangs in it's sheath behind the
    end of the bed. Two ninjas with black cloth around their heads and swords
    jump through the skylight smashing it so glass scatters around them. Each of
    them is hanging one handed from the same rope coming down from the skylight.
    The rope ends just above the inlaid frame below. The two ninjas shouts at
    Richard Stallman, from four speech bubbles which have pointy ends to
    indicate how the two alternately speaks. (These bubbles are white not
    gray).]

    Richard Stallman: Zzzz

    Top Ninja: Richard Stallman! Your viral open source licenses have grown too
    powerful.

    Bottom Ninja: The GPL must be stopped.

    Top Ninja:  At the source.

    Bottom Ninja: You.

    [In the second inlaid panel (with normal white background) Richard Stallman
    wakes up immediately, and while sitting up in bed he pulls out both his
    katana swords from their sheaths leaving the sheaths under and behind the
    bed. One hand is up in the air with the sword from behind the bed, and the
    other is still pointing down with the swords from below the bed. Lines
    indicate the fast movement of the swords. His three speech bubbles are like
    those of the ninjas, the last two even breaking the panel entering into the
    large first panel.]

    Katana swords: Shing! Shing!

    Richard Stallman: Hah! Microsoft lackeys! So it has come to this!

    Richard Stallman: A night of blood I've long awaited. But be this my death
    or yours, free software will carry on! For a GNU dawn! For freedom!

    Richard Stallman: ...Hey, where are you going?

    [An outside scene at night with black sky. Richard Stallmans gray house can
    be seen with the broken white skylight on the roof. The ninjas are jumping
    out of a window at ground height while taking of their ninja cloth around
    their heads, holding them in their hand, thus revealing they both look like
    Cueball. The first one is already on the grassy ground beneath the window
    his sword pointing down and to the left, the other just jumps from the
    window pane his sword pointing up and to the right. Again they have speech
    bubbles like before. It is not possible to tell which of the two ninjas from
    before is first out the window.]

    Ninja in window: Man, you're right, that never gets old.

    Ninja on the grass: Let's do Eric S. Raymond next.

    [There is only one large panel in this comic, but it is still divided up
    into 19 individual scenes one following the other, but of very different
    size and details. In every scene there is at least one word noted, mainly
    just stating what Cueball does. The first row has four scenes (1-4), the
    second row only two (5-6), the third row has three (7-9), the fourth four
    (10-13), the fifth five (14-18) and then the last scene takes up the middle
    of the sixth row (19).]

    [Scene 1: Cueball is seen sitting behind a table facing out of the panel
    drawing on a paper with a cup next to him on the table. An arrow points down
    to the paper from above where the sketch he is drawing is shown on a zoom in
    on the paper. He has drawn a cylinder shown in the top left, next to it is a
    detailed diagram of the cylinder in a cross section down it's length,
    showing it is hollow, with electrical terminals on either end. The
    dimensions of the cylinders length, both inner and outer are indicated on
    each side of this diagram. Below right is a cross section through circular
    section indicating the diameter. The the bottom left there is an instruction
    showing the cylinder can be opened in one end and and an arrow with a label
    points into the open cylinder. The label can be read, but the dimensions are
    unreadable.]

    Draw

    Label: Sand

    [Scene 2: Cueball is at a workbench making the device in a workshop. The
    main part of the cylinder can already be seen lying on the table, as Cueball
    works on another part. His sketch is also resting on the table leaning up
    against the rear part of the workbench where four rows with three small
    drawers in all except the second row from the top, where there is only two,
    the left of those two drawers standing open. On the edge of the table two
    tools looking like hammers hangs down. On the floor lies three small
    rectangular items.]

    Make 

    Make

    [Scene 3: Cueball kneels down on a beach and scoops up sand in a beaker. To
    the left a fairly large wave (the surf) can be seen far down along the
    beach. Above the sea there is a large cloud and a smaller one. To the right
    of the beach is a dense forest growing close to the surf. The tree trunks
    are visible as are the leafs, but most trees and trunks are not possible to
    single out, except one large tree standing a little further out than the
    rest just behind Cueball. The trunk of this tree looks a little like a palm
    tree trunk, but it has a regular crown of normal leaves.]

    Scoop

    [Scene 4: Cueball sitting behind a table pours the sand from the beaker into
    the cylinder. The lid of the cylinder lies on the table next to a full
    glass. If it is full of water or more sand is not clear. The beaker used to
    pour sand is not transparent as the glass on the table.]

    Pour

    [Scene 5: Cueball ties a spool of string to one end of the cylinder, and
    ties a deflated weather balloon, lying on the ground to the right, to the
    other end. The spool lies on the ground to the left.]

    Tie

    [Scene 6: The weather balloon is inflated, and Cueball raises it up into the
    clouds as thunder rumbles in the huge dark clouds to the right. The cylinder
    is clearly visible just below the balloon. To the left towards the horizon
    there is something that may be a distant city, but the there are some lines
    going away from it away from the horizon, the meaning of which is unclear,
    could be electrical wires in the air for transporting electricity.]

    Rumble

    [Scene 7: Cueball has left after having tied the end of the string is to a
    stake in the ground. The sky is completely covered with clouds and the first
    lightning is flashing in the background thunder following. The balloon hangs
    close to the clouds, the cylinder barely visible at this distance.]

    Boom

    [Scene 8: Lightning hits the balloon and travels all the way down tot he
    rod, that can just be seen at the bottom. There is a loud crack and a number
    is noted next to the incandescent ballon inside the lightning. Could be a
    temperature?]

    Crack

    7565

    [Scene 9: A slim image with a zoom in just of the cylinder as the lightning
    hits, showing it attached to the wires going up and down from each of the
    two terminals. The lightning travels along the wire through the cylinder and
    out the other wire fusing the sand contents within.]

    Fuse

    [Scene 10: The clouds are disappearing to the left and the suns out again to
    the left. Two birds fly in the distance near the sun and below them there is
    a hill in the horizon. Cueball, holding on to the string with one hand,
    follows the string to the cylinder lying on the ground. Above this scene
    there is a frame with a caption:]

    Later

    Follow

    [Scene 11: Cueball detaches the cylinder from the wire that goes to the
    remains of the burned out balloon lying on the ground to the right. The
    other part of the wire still hangs down from the cylinders other end.]

    Detach

    [Scene 12: Zoom in on Cueball as he opens the cylinder, letting a wisp of
    smoke out. The cylinder has clearly been exposed to some rough condition,
    it's surface flaking off. Cueballs hands are clearly visible, which is an
    unusual style in xkcd.]

    Open

    [Scene 13: Cueball puts his hands into the cylinder and removes a piece of
    glass with a zigzag shape. Leftover sand pouting out as he draws it out of
    the open cylinder.]

    Remove 

    [Scene 14: Back at his table, (with only the surface shown), Cueball admires
    the piece of glass holding it between both of his hands. The broken and open
    cylinder lies on the table sand pouring out and the lid lies to the left.]

    Admire

    [Scene 15: Cueball is looking at White Hat (a jeweler) standing behind his
    desk under a large sign hanging from a string put over a peck in the wall
    above the desk. White Hat examines the glass holding it up in his hand and
    looking at it with a magnifying glass he is holding up to his eye. A lamp is
    standing on the table]

    Sign: Jeweler

    Examine

    [Scene 16: White Hat, only, grinds the glass on a grindstone he has put on
    his desk, pieces of glass seems to be flying away from the stone. There are
    four indeterminate tools lying on the table.]

    Grind

    [Scene 17: White Hat, only, sets the now-shining glass in a necklace having
    cleared the table from any other items.]

    Set

    [Scene 18: Cueball holds the glass necklace in both hands looking at it and
    approves the final result while White Hat is standing behind his desk with
    something small and rectangular in his hand, probably the money Cueball paid
    for his service.]

    Approve

    [Scene 19: Cueball gives the glass necklace to Megan, almost touching it and
    her hands with an outstretched hand. Megan admires the shining piece of
    glass she now holds in her hands, the string hanging down from her hands.]

    [Everything is one big panel.]

    The Electromagnetic Spectrum

    These waves travel through the electromagnetic field. They were formerly
    carried by the aether, which was decommissioned in 1897 due to budget cuts.

    Other waves:

    Slinky waves [Cueball and Megan hold the ends of a tangled slinky.]

    Sound waves [There is a snippet of a frequency band. Between 20 Hz and 20
    KHz is labeled "Audible Sound." Towards the top is a line labeled "That
    high-pitched noise in empty rooms."]

    The wave [A row of people does a wave.]


    [Three parallel scales are across the bottom. The first is lambda (m),
    ranging from 100Mm to 100fm; second is f (Hz), which starts at 1 Hz and
    reaches 100 THz about 2/3 of the way along, after which the labels read
    "other entertaining greek prefixes like peta- exa- and zappa-"; last is Q
    (Gal^2/Coloumb), whose labels are 17, 117, pi, 17, 42, theta, e^pi-pi, -2,
    540^50, and 11^2. Above the scales and lined up accurately with the first
    two are the following:]

    Power & Telephone (100Mm to 1km)

    Radio & TV (1km to somewhere between 1m and 10cm); above that are many boxes
    showing subranges (AM, VHF, UHF, 14/7 NPR pledge drives, a very thin band
    for the space rays controlling Steve Ballmer, 99.3 "The Fox," 101.5 "The
    Badger," 106.3 "The Frightened Squirrel," cell phone cancer rays, CIA, ham
    radio, kosher radio, shouting car dealership commercials.)

    Microwaves (a bit more than 10cm to a bit more than 1mm); it also has
    subranges (aliens, just below SETI, wifi, FHF, brain waves, sulawesi,
    gravity)

    Toasters (about 1mm to about 100 micrometers)

    IR (about 100 micrometers to somewhere between 1 micrometer and 1 nm); above
    that is a bell graph labeled "Superman"s heat vision," with a motorcycle
    driving up the left side labeled "Jack Black's Heat Vision."

    Visible light (and, under it, visible dark); above that is a bell graph
    labeled "sunlight." There's a breakout chart above it showing the visible
    spectrum from 700nm (red) to 450nm (violet). There's an arrow pointing to
    where octarine would be, somewhere off to the side. Above that are bars
    showing the absorption spectra for hydrogen, helium, Depends(R) (yellow
    only) and Tampax(R) (red only).

    UV (about 100nm to about 10nm)

    Miller Light (a thin bar around 10nm)

    An unlabeled section with a thin line above it showing the frequency of the
    main death star laser

    A blocked-off portion labeled "Censored Under Patriot Act."

    X-rays (from about 1nm to about 10pm); a line above shows the frequency of
    mail-order x-ray glasses. Somewhere vaguely above the 10pm mark is a potato.

    Gamma/cosmic rays (10pm and smaller); above that is a bar marked Sinister
    Google Projects which also trails off into higher frequencies, and
    blogorays, which are slightly lower.

    Our solution: the Cuddle Mattress!

    Your lower arms fit in the convenient gap.

    [There is a diagram of a mattress with a notch cut through it at shoulder
    level. The gap is indicated with an arrow.]

    [The same couple is shown again, cuddling snugly on the mattress.]

    Listener: I want one.

    Listener: Although... so the lower arms just sort of dangle?

    Listener: What do you do with them?

    Cueball: It was a bit awkward.

    Clicker: click

    Megan: Then we had a second breakthrough.

    [The couple is shown again on the cuddle mattress, this time in more detail

    Cueball: Second-greatest.

    Friend: Oh?

    [The next panel is only half height as Cueball's narration is written as a
    caption above the panel without a frame around it. In the panel to the left
    lies a young Elaine with a ponytail on the floor typing at a keyboard while
    looking at a screen connected to a computer behind it with lots of wires and
    open case. The computer appears to have been pieced together and there is a
    screwdriver lying next to her and an open box lies behind her. Little Bobby
    Tables (a kid version of Cueball) is painting with a broad brush at an easel
    to the left. There is a clear drawing with two parts going up and one down,
    but it's not easy to see what it should look like. He is holding his other
    hand up in the air, like he is enjoying the painting.]

    Cueball (narrating): Mrs. Roberts had two children. Her son, Bobby, was
    never much for computers, but her daughter Elaine took to them like a ring
    in the bell.

    [The front of a car is in frame with side mirror and steering wheel visible.
    Mrs. Roberts is waving goodbye to her daughter who is wearing a backpack and
    is holding a walking stick. She is about to begin climbing a staircase built
    into a rocky mountain side. The first 11 step are visible. Behind the two
    and the stair are two distant mountain peaks, and above them two clouds.
    Cueball continues to narrate, this time inside the panel:]

    Cueball (narrating): When Elaine turned 11, her mother sent her to train
    under Donald Knuth in his mountain hideaway.

    [Donald Knuth, drawn with hair only around his neck, is standing with a
    pointing stick at a chalk board with graph traversal patterns on it and two
    blocks of unreadable text the top may be a matrix. This small panel is also
    lower than the next panel, with Cueballs narration above:]

    Cueball (narrating): For four years she studied algorithms.

    Donald Knuth: Child—

    [Donald Knuth whips around from the board slashing the stick like a sword.
    Elaine jumps, making a somersault (indicated with a line curving on it self
    from floor to sword) and lands on the stick balancing with her arms out.]

    Donald Knuth: Why is A* search wrong in this situation?

    Stick: swish

    Elaine: Memory usage!

    Donald Knuth: What would you use?

    Elaine: Dijkstra's algorithm!

    [Donald Knuth and Elaine are outside, seen from behind while they are both
    writing on a chalkboard with a thick line down the middle to separate their
    work. On both sides their writing can be seen but it is unreadable. Where
    there is only text visible on Donald Knuth's side there is also what appears
    to be a drawing or matrix at the top of Elaine's. But a similar thing could
    be behind Donald Knuth's head. Elaine is no longer wearing her hair in a
    ponytail but have long straight white hair like her mom Mrs. Roberts. To the
    left there is a stump from a tree, some grass and maybe a poodle of water.
    Further back there is a small jagged hill and a flat horizon. To the right
    there are four mountain peaks and a flat high plateau towards the horizon.
    The frame of the panel does not include the top and bottom corner, but cuts
    a rectangular section of both places. In these two sections outside the
    panel is the last two paragraphs of Cueball's narrating:]

    Cueball (narrating): Until one day she bested her master

    Donald Knuth: So our lower bound here is O(n log n)

    Elaine: Nope. Got it in O(n log (log n))

    Cueball (narrating): And left.

    from the first panel in the 2nd comic in the series:]

    Cueball (narrating): As time passed, Elaine intensified her hacking work,
    anonymously publishing exploit after exploit.

    [Elaine, wearing a backpack, is walking up to a door where her mom Mrs.

    Cueball (narrating): To crack open proprietary hardware, she teamed up with
    one of the top experts in signal processing and data transferring protocols.

    it open.]

    Knife: Shink

    [Pan back right to the two men who simultaneously pull a katana sword out of

    goes up from the keyboard indicating activity. Elaine still holds her open
    folding knife out, so the tip now touches the right frame of the panel.]

    Mrs. Roberts: Don't let them provoke you, dear.

    Man (off-panel): We don't want to hurt you, Ma'am.

    Mrs. Roberts: Don't by silly. Record company employees can't just go into
    houses and slice people up.

    their briefcase closed on the floor. The closest RIAA man is holding a hand
    up, the other MPAA man is holding his sword in two hands and pointing it

    [The two men in black bowler hats (RIAA and MPAA agents as known from the

    her folding knife and Richard Stallman with his own two katana swords.
    Elaine kicks the RIAA man to the left in the back of his leg, while Stallman
    jumps over the MPAA man to the right, flying high over him from right to
    left in a flying maneuver hitting his sword while hanging parallel to the
    ground above the man.]

    Elaine: Thanks, Stallman!

    Richard Stallman: 'Tis my pleasure.

    [Elaine stands to the left with her knife in one hand having folded it down
    again. Richard Stallman stands between the two men with bowler hats who are
    now lying on the floor on either side of him each with one of Stallman's
    sword pointing at their throat. Stallman has both arms fulle stretched
    towards them as he looks straight out of the panel. The left (RIAA) man lies
    flat on his back his hat and katana sword lying behind him. The right (MPAA)
    man is sitting on his knee leaning as far back as he can, since the sword is
    almost touching his skin on his throat. He wears his hat, but the sword lies
    behind him, out of reach, even though he is leaning back on one hand close
    to it. To the far right a rope comes down from the top of the panel falling
    down on the ground so a section of it stretches even farther right in the
    picture. Down this rope comes a man with googles and a red cape, which is
    black on the inside. This is Cory Doctorow. He holds on to the rope with two
    hands one over one just under his head.]

    Elaine: So, wait - how did you know we were in trouble?

    Richard Stallman: My friend here was tracking these thugs from his balloon. 

    Richard Stallman: He called me and I thought I'd stop by

    Cory Doctorow: -Hi! 

    Cory Doctorow: -Cory Doctorow - It's a pleasure to meet you.

    [Elaine has shifted the knife to the other hand. Richard Stallman has moved
    to the left of the RIAA man, so both bowler hat men are between him and Cory
    Doctorow. Stallman still points his sword in their direction, but they are
    lowered. The RIAA man closest to him, has picked up his hat in one hand and
    reaches for his sword with the other hand. The MPAA man now lies on his
    back, one arm up leaning on the other. His sword is gone. It does not seem
    like Doctorow could have taken it. Behind him Doctorow has reached the
    ground, the rope hangs behind him. He points left.]

    Elaine: Balloon?

    Richard Stallman: Aye. They're up there constructing something called a
    "Blogosphere."

    Cory Doctorow: Yup! It's twenty kilometers up, just above the tag clouds.

    [The scene is contracted, so to the left Mrs. Roberts at her desk with her
    chair and laptop becomes visible (from the previous comic). This witout the
    other people have moved closer. She still types as her son Lille Bobby
    Tables enters and lifts a hand in his mothers direction. He is drawn as a
    child version of Cueball. Elaine has put the knife away, and looks at
    Richard Stallman who now stand straight looking at her, with the swords
    crossed in front of his legs. Behind him just right of the rope hanging
    down, Cory Doctorow lift one of the bowler hat guys up by the throat while
    looking right and talking to him. The other bowler hat guy has left the
    panel. The one he holds has his hat but no sword.]

    Little Bobby Tables: Mom, I'm hungry.

    Mrs. Roberts: Hush! I'm coding. You ate yesterday.

    Richard Stallman: You know, Roberts, GNU could use a good coder like you.
    Ever thought of joining us?

    Elaine: Maybe someday. Right now I've got an industry to take down. 

    Elaine: Music doesn't need these assholes.

    Cory Doctorow: Begone! And never darken our comment threads again!

    [Zoom in on Elaine, Richard Stallman and Cory Doctorow. She stand straight
    looking at Stallman who faces towards her swords now on his back crossed.
    Doctorow is also facing her and holds out both arms towards her. The rope is
    now outside the panel as are both bowler hat men.]

    Richard Stallman: Well, you won't fix the industry with random exploits. You
    need to encourage sharing in the public mind.

    Doctorow: Hey; With your music and coding backgrounds, you should get into
    building better P2P systems.

    [The final panel is only a third of the length of the previous panel. The
    three are still in the panel but they have moved and are also drawn somewhat
    smaller. Elaine still faces them right, but now Cory Doctorow is in front of
    Richard Stallman swords as before. All have their arms down.]

    Elaine: What? Straight-up piracy?

    Cory Doctorow: Sure- have you ever considered it? You'd make a wonderful
    dread pirate, Roberts

    [To the right of the final panel is a two column epilogue narrated by
    Cueball as seen in part 2. It is split in three paragraphs and a
    "signature". The caption above is centered over the two columns]

    Epilogue

    'Summer Glau'.

    Cueball: In conclusion, on examining the above post by CrackMonkey74, after
    carefully working my way through the haze of spelling errors (documented in
    section 3), abuse of capitalization (section 4), and general crimes against
    grammar and syntax (sections 7-8), I have demonstrated that, beneath it all,
    the work betrays the author's staggering ignorance of the history and the
    workings of our electoral system. While the author's wildly swerving train
    of thought did at one point flirt with coherence, this brief encounter was
    more likely a chance event (see statistical analysis in table 5) than a
    result of even rudimentary lucidity.

    shoulders, without the hat changes size. The movement is indicated with two
    lines above the hat. Black Hat crosses his arms across his chest and bends

    width is somewhere between the first two panels. Cueball and Megan looks at
    the hat, Cueball with a hand in front of his mouth.]

    Around us, the party waned, but we hid from sleep together, talking through
    the deepest hours of the night.

    The dawn found us curled up on a couch, asleep but still together.

    That experience, connecting with a stranger and falling recklessly in love
    is one of life's greatest joys.

    And now that you're married, you'll never experience it again.

    It's the price you pay for everlasting love. It's a small one, but I hope it
    stings a little.

    Anyway, I wish you and Megan the best.

    holds in her hands. There is a picture of Black Hat on a screen behind her.
    There is a caption below the picture.]

    Blondie: Breaking news—the President has made a nomination to the new post
    of Internet Secretary. We know little about the man, shown here.

    Caption: Possibly a haberdasher?

    [Blondie keeps talking over a scene showing her standing with a microphone
    in front of a water filled moat that has been dug between the road and a
    house. A small stair up to the house is just on the other side of the moat.
    Behind her is Cueball with a large TV camera on his shoulder pointing
    towards her and the house.]

    Blondie (narrating): Attempts to reach the nominee at home were
    unsuccessful.

    Blondie: What the hell kind of apartment has a moat?

    [Back to Blondie behind her desk, the paper is gone and she leans one arm on
    the desk. There is no screen behind her.]

    Blondie: To understand the culture from which he came — and which he may
    soon administer — we sent a reporter to what we're told is the source of
    that culture. 

    Blondie: Tom?

    [This panel is much larger than the three previous panels and partly hidden
    behind the last. Tom, looking like Cueball with a military helmet with
    camouflage marks strapped under his chin, holds a large microphone in front
    of him while standing in front of a large screen. The screen shows with a
    message board with four picture posts. Each picture has a text to the right
    but those are unreadable scribbles. The top drawing is of a man with wild
    hair who holds out his hands with thumbs up. The next is text. Then there is
    a circle with a smaller circle in the middle and at the bottom what appears
    to be a Cueball-like man with a fencing mask. Blondie still speaks to him
    from off-panel left.]

    Tom: I'm coming to you live from the 4chan /b/ board. Despite the tube
    cloggage, nascent memes are flying fast and furious.

    Blondie (off-panel): Why are you wearing a helmet, Tom?

    Ron Paul (off-panel): Ahoy! What news of the blogs?

    from the controls towards Ron Paul drawn like Cueball but with a cane. She
    holds up a piece of paper with a small square insert visible at the top.
    Apart from that it is white.]

    Ron Paul: It's not me?

    from the airship. There is text on the blimp, with the four letters after
    the first written mirrored to spell another word.]

    lifted to his chin. His cane leans against his legs. Ponytail looks at him
    from her chair, the paper now held in her lap.]

    Ron Paul: They mustn't put him in charge. Quick, call the capitol!

    [Ponytail turns around on her chair towards the controls and takes hold of
    one of the sticks. Ron Paul has taken the cane in his hand again.]

    Ponytail: Can't, sir. The tubes just went down completely.

    Ron Paul: Blast!

    [Ponytail now holds on to both sticks as Ron Paul lifts his cane up into the
    air pointing away from her up and right.]

    Ron Paul: Then we'll go ourselves. Full speed ahead!

    [A full vies of the blimp hanging in the air to the left over a broad
    landscape. There seems to be a small lake just in front of the blimp. The
    horizon is shown all along this full width panel and after the lake there
    are five small mountain peaks, two behind the three in front. After the last
    of these there follows one more peak and a small mound. Features are shown
    on the ground. In the air in front of the blimp there are a small cloud
    inside the panel at the end of the lake, and a large cloud breaking the

    and mound.]

    to the right.]

    So I'm stuck in this desert for eternity.

    I don't know why. I just woke up here one day.

    [The next four panels take up the second line of the comic.]

    [Cueball stand in the desert.]

    I never feel hungry or thirsty.

    [Cueball walks in the desert.]

    I just walk.

    [Zooming out while Cueball continues to walk in the desert.]

    Sand and rocks

    [Zooming far out as Cueball again just stands in the desert. First line of
    text, above him, is a continuation of the text in the previous panel. The
    second line is below him.]

    stretch to infinity.

    As best as I can tell.

    [The next three panels take up the third line of the comic. The last takes
    up half the width.]

    [Cueball is sitting in the desert, in a contemplative position. First line
    of text above him the second below.]

    There's plenty of time for thinking out here.

    An eternity really.

    [Cueball is sketching stuff in the sand. First line of text above him the
    second below.]

    I've rederived modern math in the sand

    and then some.

    [Three different graph types are depicted. First line of text above them the
    second below.]

    Physics too. I worked out the kinks in quantum mechanics and relativity.

    Took a lot of thinking, but this place has fewer distractions than a Swiss
    patent office.

    [The next eight panels take up the fourth and fifth line of the comic. All
    pictures are the same size.]

    [Cueball is walking along the desert, laying out rocks on a line. Four has
    been deployed, he is laying down the fifth and has a sixth in his other
    hand.]

    One day I started laying down rows of rocks.

    [Cueball with a rock in his hand, continues to deploy rocks 16, in a more
    intricate pattern. There are grid-lines in the sand (5 rows, 6 columns),
    with each intersection either empty of filled with a rock. No rocks lay
    anywhere but at an intersection on the grid.]

    Each new row followed from the last in a simple pattern.

    [Zooming out showing even more laid out rocks. Cueball is seen directly from
    above, and we see his shadow falling on the grid of rocks (7 rows, 14
    columns).]

    With the right set of rules and enough space,

    [Continues to zoom further out showing clear triangular patterns (with no
    rocks) in the laid out grid of rocks. Cueball is not seen. (8 rows, 42
    columns). First line of text above the grid, the second line below.]

    I was able to build a computer.

    Each new row of stones is the next iteration of the computation.

    [Zooming far out (no Cueball) with rows intersected by five clear V lines on
    top of them. The V's are drawn inside each other, with the smallest V at the
    top right, and the other V's starting just to the right of the previous one,
    and then continuing the same distance past the previous V, as the total
    length of the first V. The "*" in the first line of text above this grid,
    references to the footnote below written in a smaller font.]

    Sure it's rocks instead of electricity, but it's the same* thing. Just
    slower.

    *Turing-complete

    [Cueball stands in contemplative pose (on a clean white background - i.e. no
    dessert).]

    After a while, I programmed it to be a physics simulator.

    [A black panel with white drawings and text. A small white dot (a particle)
    is labeled by two arrows coming of two binary strings.]

    Every piece of information about a particle was encoded as a string of bits
    written in the stones.

    00101010

    00101010

    [A Feynman diagram showing two particles interacting. Two arrows going in
    and out with a snaking line between them.]

    With enough time and space, I could fully simulate two particles
    interacting.

    [The next two panels take up the sixth line of the comic. The second panel
    takes up three quarter of the width.]

    [Cueball standing before the vastness of the desert, with his programmed
    lines of rock stretching to infinity.]

    But I have infinite time and space.

    [A black panel with white drawings and text. Depiction of two large
    galaxies, one with four jets coming out of it's center, the other a flat
    disc. Several smaller galaxies and/or stars are shown around them.]

    So I decided to simulate a universe.

    [The next four panels take up the seventh line of the comic. They are of
    similar widths.]

    [Cueball is walking by his grid of rocks, lines indicate he has just thrown
    another rock down in it's place. It falls so hard it thinks into the sand
    that splashes out around it. The 14 rocks above him lies on the grid, four
    other below this grid, have not been used yet.]

    The eons blur past as I walk down a single row.

    [Zoom far far out to show multiple rows of rocks. It is not very clear that
    there are several triangular patterns (with no rocks) in different sizes in
    the laid out grid of rocks. There are about 50 rows and 90 columns. There
    are six large triangles on top of each other at the left edge. To the right
    there are three even larger triangles from top to bottom, the one in the
    middle further to the left than the one above, but further right than the
    bottom one.]

    The rows blur past to compute a single step.

    [Shows the placement of two particles in the simulation.]

    And in the simulation...

    [The two particles have moved just long enough as to not overlap with their
    the previous position which are shown as an after-image with faint gray
    lines. The text continues directly the one from the previous panel.]

    another instant ticks by.

    [The next two panels take up the eight line of the comic. They each take up
    half the width.]

    [A Cueball like person (you) observes a mote of dust vanish.]

    So if you see a mote of dust vanish from your vision in a little flash or
    something

    [Cueball is standing between two rocks on the ground, while holding two
    rocks, one lifted up to his head. The first line of text is above him. It is
    a direct continuation of the text in the previous panel. The second line
    stands below to the right of him.]

    I'm sorry. I must have misplaced a rock

    sometime in the last few billions and billions of millennia.

    [Cueball stands in the "clean" part of his infinite desert, in front of the
    vastness of his infinity of infinite lines or rocks.]

    Oh and...

    [A Cueball like student sitting in a classroom with his head in his hands,
    Megan sits behind him and a teacher points to the blackboard; A clock shows
    the time at five minutes to ten.]

    [A scientist (looking like Cueball) is pointing into an aquarium tank with
    two small animals floating in the water. He explains that they are
    cuttlefish to Cueball and Megan who are on the other side of the tank
    looking into it, Cueball with a hand to his mouth. Above them there is a
    frame inside the panel with a caption:]

    We visit a bio lab: 

    Scientist: These are cuttlefish.

    [Very detailed drawing of a cuttlefish, with it's special W shaped pupils,
    all eight arms and two longer tentacles, and the striped body with waving
    parts shown waving down each side. The scientist tells about the animal with
    text above and below.]

    Scientist (off-panel): They're frighteningly smart, have manipulating arms
    and tentacles, have ink jets, can dart backwards and see the polarization of
    light through their w-shaped pupils. 

    Scientist (off-panel): And their sides are 200 dpi display screens which
    they use for camouflage and communication.

    [Back to the original setting where the scientist stand a little further
    back from the tank with his arms down. Cueball and Megan has also moved
    further back and are even leaning away from the tank]

    Scientist: When we realized how intelligent they were, we began to teach
    them. 

    Scientist: They've advanced quickly. 

    Scientist: Cuttlefish: GO.

    [The two cuttlefish float straight out of the tank (lines indicating they
    movement water splashing at the surface of the tank). The scientist looks
    down at them, while Cueball and Megan holding hands and leans further back
    and Cueball takes his hand back to his mouth.]

    [Pan to only the scientist, standing with one arm bend in front of him and
    the other holding a finger up to his mouth, and the tank from where the
    cuttlefish now flies towards Cueball and Megan who are now off-panel. Lines
    behind the cuttlefish shows they fly right but bobbing up and down. The
    cuttlefish talks in a strange way where the letters are alternately up and
    down.]

    Cuttlefish: KILL THE PHYSICISTS

    Cuttlefish: KILL THE PHYSICISTS

    [Pan to Megan and Cueball, with the tank almost inside the left frame. Both
    cuttlefish is surrounded by their own zigzag line, which then extends from
    them in a thin line to encompass either Cueball or Megan. Cueball was
    running away from them, when this happens, legs bend at the knees and arms
    out and one bend. Megan has fallen lying face down arms out.]

    [In this panel with faint gray shading Cueball is waking up in bed from the
    dream rising up to sitting position suddenly as indicated with two movement
    lines behind his head. One arm is supporting him on the bed next to the
    pillow, and the other is pulling his sheet down away from his torso. The
    first sentence is maybe still part of the dream as there is no line from
    Cueball to the sentence, and it is written high up. There is a line to the
    second sentence.]

    Cueball: Oh god. 

    Cueball: I knew it.

    [This panel is divided into five segments. At the top there is a large
    caption in two lines. The there are three drawings following each other from
    left to right. First a bottle is pouring liquid into a an Erlenmeyer flask
    (a conical laboratory flask) which is half full. Then Cueball takes the
    flask and holds it up as a salute. Finally he drinks from it leaning his
    head way back. Below there is more text.]

    "that's warmer than a house but cool for swimming."

    Etch-a-Sketch: Hi!

    Etch-a-Sketch screen.]

    Megan: You're cute!

    Cueball: Wha—

    Megan (out of the Etch-a-Sketch): I'm the one who draws when you turn the

    Megan (out of the Etch-a-Sketch): It's lonely in here.

    break away into thought bubbles.]

    Megan (out of the Etch-a-Sketch): Let's be friends

    Megan (out of the Etch-a-Sketch): And never be alone again.

    [The next panel is almost gone in the thought bubbles. In the remaining top
    left corner there are three pink hearts, the top one of these looks like it
    was drawn on an Etch-a-Sketch.]

    [From the last two panels the above turns out to have been a fantasy of
    Cueball. There is a rather large break between the first three lines of
    panels to the last line. Between the previous line of panels (from the
    middle panel ) to the last line, there are three large circles, which then
    continues with seven more inside the next panel down to Cueball sitting with

    turbines.]

    Cueball: I'm all for green energy, but those turbines creep me out. They
    remind me of War of the Worlds, or the Tripod books.

    wiggly lines form around the last word to indicate a high rumbling sound.]

    Boom

    [A panel even wider than the first, but the same height as the 2nd and 3rd
    panel. Four of the wind turbines rampage across the field. Six smoke plumes
    rise from the ground where there are also nine to ten distinct red fires
    burning. The turbines move towards towers and buildings to the right.]

    [Cueball and Megan are now both standing. This panel and the last three
    panels in the last row is all the same size, a third of the total comic in
    width and the same height as the previous panel.]

    obviously types his reply on the keyboard. Across the top border of the

    (facing the other way towards Stephenie in the previous panel). He writes
    his reply on the keyboard and receives a reply from Stephenie coming out of

    Pimpled boy (typing): And what, call the internet police? You don't get it,
    do you? We've been trolling for years. We're all anonymous. There's nothing

    text is thus cut off at the edges of the frame. The first eight lines can be
    read clearly, even though the last letter in both the 2nd and sixth line is
    partly cut-off. Below that there are four incomplete lines, where only the
    visible part will be transcribed, but a good guess at the missing text is
    written in square brackets. Across the top border of the frame is a smaller

    text Dawnz. The third picture shows a person from the chest and up. The
    person has black hair and black clothes, with some kind of collar. The

    be seen coming from the screen with a zigzag line, and Cueball writes a
    response as seen from the line going from his hand on the keyboard up to his
    message.]

    try to spend a weekend at home without internet.

    [The text is above the picture in a square frame. A computer screen is
    shown. It displays an on-line video player, with what appears to be a
    Cueball-like guy performing cunnilingus on a Megan-like girl. Five other
    windows (maybe ads) are also visible, though what they depict is not clear.
    One of them has readable text above a picture (of what appear to be a
    fleshlight). The rest of the text, including a heading at the top, is

    [The first panel is very large and shows a dark scene with one large meteor
    in front and four smaller in the background showering the darkened earth.
    They are all five black with yellow fire around them and a fire trail behind
    them, and all are flying from the top left corner and down towards right.
    The sky at the top is pitch black, but then the sky turns blood red under
    dark clouds. Two large mountain peaks, one almost pyramid shaped, are shown
    to the left and to the right there are two smaller peaks towards the distant
    horizon. The mountains and the ground around them are mainly black, but with
    red, orange and yellow streaks spread all over the black area beneath the
    mountain peaks, maybe indicating fire or lava, or reflections in water or
    blood. At the bottom right corner a normal white panel is superimposed on
    this apocalyptic image.]

    [The smaller panel at the bottom of the first is halfway over the first
    panel, haflway below, and only to the right of the middle of the first
    panel. Beret Guy is running towards left, with his arms raised in the air.]

    Beret Guy: The Apocalypse! The skies burn, the seas turn to blood, and the
    dead walk the earth!

    [From here a normal sequence of panles in three rows begin beneath the
    second panel. This leaves a gap between the apocalyptic panel and the third
    row of panel, on the left side where the 2nd panel did not reach over. In
    this panel Beret Guy (coming from the right) finds Cueball.]

    Cueball: The dead what?

    Beret Guy: Walk the earth!

    [Cueball running right in a thin panel.]

    Cueball: I have to go.

    a pen on a paper. Mathematical symbols appear above Cueball's head,

    Five people are lining up to sign the paper lying on the right side of the
    table. The first who signs with a pen is Blondie, then in line follows
    Megan, a Cueball-like guy, Ponytail and another Cueball-like guy who stand
    with one hand to his chin looking right, away from the other.]

    Blondie: At last!

    Guy looking right: I hope there's time!

    Sign: Cemetery 

    Rising dead (off-panel): Hurrghhh

    [Cueball, still going right, arrives at a grave, pen in hand and the other
    hand almost outside the panel, but with a corner of the paper just visible.
    The grave has a large gravestone to the right and in front of it there is a
    Cueball-like guy rising up from the ground using his arms to push up on the
    base of the stone and the small pile of earth towards Cueball. The guy looks
    very worn, with dirt on his head and scratches on his cheek.]

    man who looks up at him when he is addressed-]

    on the ground looking up at the sky with her hands behind her head. Peter
    (a.k.a. Locke, looking like Cueball) is attracting a squirrel with some food
    his hand.]

    Valentine: Ender's up there saving the world, but down here it's falling
    apart politically. What can we do?

    [Peter turns towards and sits down, leaning back on one hand. Valentine sits
    up in a similar position. Her hair looks like a mix between Megan and

    thrown out for it.]

    Peter: I know — we get on the nets and anonymously post political opinions.
    People reading our articles will see our intelligence, recognize how clear
    and logical our arguments are, and insist that we be put in charge, so we
    can fix everything!

    Valentine: Brilliant!

    to the wall, as the line soon goes off panel at the top, but it seems to be
    directed at a small white half circle at the top of the panel. The line
    begins in front of the last of the handles at the top, a small one, and
    below this there is a larger handle bending up making it easy to hold on to.
    Cueball is holding on with his hands to two similar "easy" handles.]

    in front of the line, and his lower leg and upper knee touches the two
    handles his hands where on before. Here he has stopped climbing and lifts
    his head back to look up and sees Megan standing there above him (as she was
    also doing at the top of the previous panel, but cut of at leg and face).

    Main Text

    Gravity Wells scaled to Earth surface gravity

    This chart shows the "depth" of various solar system gravity wells.

    Each well is scaled such that rising out of a physical well of that depth —
    in constant Earth surface gravity — would take the same energy as escaping
    from that planet's gravity in reality.

    Each planet is shown cut in half at the bottom of its well, with the depth
    of the well measured down to the planet's flat surface.

    The planet sizes are to the same scale as the wells. Interplanetary
    distances are not to scale.

    Depth = (G × PlanetMass) / (g × PlanetRadius)

    G = Newton's constant

    g = 9.81 m/s2

    Mercury

    Venus

    Earth - 6379 km [originally 5,478 km]

    Moon - 288 km

    Mars - 1,286 km

    Ganymede

    Io

    Jupiter

    [A drawing of a "very deep" gravity well, "Your mom" at the bottom, several
    member of "local football team" falling down towards her.]

    Jupiter is not much larger than Saturn, but much more massive. At its size,
    adding more mass just makes it denser due to the extra squeezing of gravity.

    If you dropped a few dozen more Jupiters into it, the pressure would ignite
    fusion and make it a star.

    Mars Inset

    [Mars gravity well, with one of the Mars rovers on its surface, with its
    moons Deimos and Phobos as smaller gravity wells.]

    [Figure of a man (to scale) in Deimos's gravity well.]

    You could escape Deimos with a bike and a ramp.

    [Figure of a man (to scale) in Phobos's gravity well.]

    A thrown baseball could escape Phobos.

    Earth Inset

    [Zoomed-in view of Earth/moon gravity well, featuring the relative locations
    of the atmosphere, Low Earth Orbit, the International Space Station, the
    Space Shuttle, GPS satellites, and satellites in geosynchronous orbit.]

    Cueball: This is why it took a huge rocket to get to the moon but only a
    small one to get back.

    It takes the same amount of energy to launch something on an escape
    trajectory away from Earth as it would to launch it 6,000 km upward under
    constant 9.81 m/s2 Earth gravity.

    Hence, Earth's well is 6,000 km deep.

    [Movie: Cueball passes a test tube to Ponytail sitting at a large control
    console to the left looking at it's glowing screens at the bottom. At the
    top there is a flashing lamp. Both are wearing lab coats and goggles. A a

    goggles. Ponytail place a sample from a test tube into a small device
    standing on a table. An analog clock on the wall above them is at five
    minutes past ten.]

    [Movie: A small glowing sample has been placed next to a rat inside a cage
    standing on a table. Ponytail, is holding a glowing implement up towards the
    cage; she has another rat in her hand and also a rat sitting on top of her
    head. Cueball is speaking into a device with a curled wire going to the
    wall.]

    Machine: ...whirrrrrr...

    [Movie: Zoom in on Ponytail who pulls on two levers on a machine, which is
    shooting a beam of some sort downwards onto a sample, possibly the same as
    in the cage with the rat.]

    [Actual: Cueball and Ponytail still waits for their sample to be analyzed in
    the small device. The clock on the wall above them is at twenty five minutes
    past eleven. Cueball has removed his goggles when the machine finally
    completes the test.]

    Machine: ...whirrrr...

    I wanted to make you a science valentine

    with charts and graphs of my feelings for you.

    [A graph shows romance and happiness. Romance cuts off, indicating a breakup
    before the meeting of Cueball and his current significant other, and
    happiness dips accordingly.

    A line indicates where the couple first met; romance is jagged thereafter,
    initially upwards but later down.

    Happiness climbs slightly more steadily and then dips again.

    More lines indicate a period of dating and then one of engagement.]

    and the happiness you've brought me.

    r0 = 0.20

    r1 = -0.61

    In science, you can't publish results you know are wrong

    and you can't withhold them because they're not the ones you wanted.

    So I was left with a question: do I make graphs because they're cute and
    funny,

    [Black Hat is standing to the left behind Cueball, who is sitting in an
    office chair at his desk working on his computer. A message from the
    computer is indicated with a zigzag line from the screen.]

    Black Hat: Password entropy is rarely relevant. The real modern danger is
    password reuse.

    Cueball: How so?

    Computer: Password too weak

    [Zoom in on Black Hat's upper part as he holds a hand up with the palm up.]

    Black Hat: Set up a Web service to do something simple, like image hosting
    or tweet syndication, so a few million people set up free accounts.

    [Zoom out to Black Hat standing in front of Cueball who has turned in the
    chair facing Black Hat, the desk is not shown in the panel.]

    Black Hat: Bam, you've got a few million emails, default usernames, and
    passwords.

    [Only Black Hat is shown as he holds out his arms.]

    Black Hat: Tons of people use one password, strong or not, for most
    accounts.

    [The next panel is only half the height of the other panels. Above the panel
    is the text that Black Hat narrates. In the left part of the panel there is
    a piece of paper that seems to have been torn of at the bottom with
    resulting in a jagged edge, could also indicate that it continues further
    down than shown. On the paper there is three labeled columns, and below each
    of them about 18 lines of unreadable sentences (mostly just one word). The @
    in the e-mail addresses may be indicated with a larger unreadable sign. To
    the right a broad line goes right from the paper and splits up in five lines
    that goes up or down ending in five arrows to the right pointing at five
    labels.]

    Black Hat (narrating): Use the list and some proxies to try automated logins
    to the 20 or 30 most popular sites, plus banks and PayPal and such.

    [Same setting as panel 3 but Cueball has taken a hand to his chin.]

    Black Hat: You've now got a few hundred thousand real identities on a few
    dozen services, and nobody suspects a thing.

    Cueball: And then what?

    [Same setting in a larger panel with more white space to the left, Cueball
    has his hand down again.]

    Black Hat: Well, that's where I got stuck.

    Cueball: You did this?

    Black Hat: Why do you think I hosted so many unprofitable web services?

    [Zoom in on Black Hat's head now turned towards left.]

    Black Hat: I could probably net in a lot of money, one way or another, if I
    did things carefully. But research shows more money doesn't make people
    happier, once they make enough to avoid day-to-day financial stress.

    [Zooming a bit out, but still only showing Black Hat's head in the bottom
    right corner, again facing right.]

    Black Hat: I could mess with people endlessly, but I do that already. I
    could get a political or religious idea out to most of the world, but since
    March of 1997 I don't really believe in anything.

    [This panel is the last in this row, but it does not reach the end of the
    row above, an indication that this do not directly belong to the panels
    below. Same setting as panel 3 but Black Hat has his arms out.]

    Black Hat: So, here I sit, a puppetmaster who wants nothing from his
    puppets.

    Black Hat: It's the same problem Google has.

    Cueball: Oh?

    [This panel is the first in the last row. It does not begin to the left, but
    has been shifted a bit to the right, just as the last panel above tot he
    right, ended before reaching the right edge of the row above (and this one
    below). This is to indicate that this is row has a different story. A
    Cueball-like executive at Google is standing up leaning his arms on a table
    with Google's logo on the side. His office chair has been pushed to the left
    behind him and it is partly off-panel. He addresses the other executives at
    the table, two of which are shown. The first is Hairbun with glasses holding
    her head with both hands, elbows resting on the table. The other executive
    is also a Cueball-like guy, his head is partly outside the right edge of the
    panel. At the top of the panel to the left there is a small frame breaking
    the panels frame, inside it there is a caption:]

    Google...

    Cueball executive: Okay, everyone, we control the world's information. Now
    it's time to turn evil. What's the plan?

    Hairbun: Make boatloads of money?

    Table: Google

    [Only the Cueball-like executive standing at the end of the tabe is shown,
    the table is left out. He is face-palming. One of the executives at the
    table is speaking off-panel. Could be either of the two above, or someone
    not shown before]

    Cueball executive: We already do!

    Executive (off-panel): Set up a companywide CoD4: Modern Warfare tournament
    each week?

    Cueball executive: That's not evil!

    Executive (off-panel): Ooh, Dibs on the lobby TV!

    Map of Online Communities

    Size on map represents volume of Daily Social activity (posts, chat, etc).
    Based on data gathered over the Spring and Summer of 2010.

    [Two insets on the upper left-hand corner shows that this map is a tiny
    portion of the huge continent of Spoken Language, encompassing portions of
    the Internet, Email, and Cell Phones (SMS).]

    [The largest landmass on the map by far, which takes up nearly the entire
    northern half of the map is "Facebook" - with large states in the south-east
    of the country labeled 'Farmville' and 'Happy Farm'. There is a much smaller
    state to the west of these called 'Farm Town'. To the north of these states
    is a large swath of unremarkable land entitled 'Northern Wasteland of Unread
    Updates.' This is directly north of the large Dopamine Sea.

    A peninsula on the south-west, just below the Plains of Awkwardly Public
    Family Interactions, houses many tiny states, such as MySpace, Orkut,
    LinkedIn, Bebo, & Hi5. It is bordered on the south by Buzzword Bay, which
    contains several islands of varying sizes. Among these are YouTube and
    Twitter (the largest), which are separated by the Social Media Consultant
    Channel. To the south-east of Twitter, across the Sea of Protocol Confusion,
    is another, equally large island. Most of it is Skype, with the north having
    two largish states called AIM and Windows Live Messenger. On the south-west
    part of the island are two smaller states called GG and Yahoo Messenger.

    The Island of Skype is extremely close to, but separated by the Great
    Firewall (a dashed line), the large landmass of QQ. It's north shore is the
    Gulf of China and Grass Mud Horse Bay. Outside of these bays, over the Great
    Firewall are two islands called Craigslist and 2Channel.

    In the Dopamine Sea, off the southern shores of Farmville and Happy Farm, is
    MMO Isle. Its largest state is WoW, with Runescape, Lineage, Maple Story,
    Habbo, and the Mountains of Steam among its notable landmarks. To the
    southeast of the island is the Gulf of Lag, in which sits the CDC Games
    island, with Eve Online.

    To the east of Twitter is Troll Bay, with such islands as Reddit and Reddit,
    Digg, Stumbleupon, Delicio.us, and Wikipedia Talk Pages. To their south are
    the IRC isles, of which one is the tiny island of #xkcd.

    East of these islands, and north of Skype island, is the Sea of Memes. In
    this sea, to the north of Craigslist and 2Channel, is an archipelago of tiny
    islands. There is an inset, labeled 'Forums.' (See below.)

    To the southwest of Twitter island, in the Sea of Opinions, are the blog
    islands. These lie south of the islands in Buzzword Bay, as well. The
    northernmost islands in this group are centered around the Bay of Drama, on
    which can be found Diary Blogs, Gossip Blogs, and Livejournal. Gossip Blogs
    share an island with Political, Music, and Tech Blogs. To the north of this
    island is a smaller island called Photo Blogs. South of Diary Blogs, and off
    the southwest coast of Music blogs is a smaller island called Fandom Blogs.
    South of Tech Blogs, off of which sprouts the small peninsula of Business
    Blogs, is the Spamblog Straits. On the other side of the straits is a large
    island made up of Miscellaneous Blogs, with two states demarcated as
    Religious Blogs and Blog Blogs. Southwest of the Blog Islands is the Sea of
    Zero (0) Comments.]

    [An inset of a group of islands in the sea of memes located on the lower
    right corner of the map, labeled 'Forums'. The largest by far is 4chan and
    /b/. Also found here are D2JSP, JLA Frums, Fan Forum, Something Awful, and
    many smaller ones, too numerous to list here.]

    [The northeastern third of Gossip/Political/Tech Blogs island is another
    inset labeled 'Blogosphere (Core)'. This can be found on the lower left
    corner of the map. Two peninsulas in Political Blogs bookend the Bay of
    Flame -- these are Liberal Blogs and Conservative Blogs. Between them lie
    several tiny islands such as Politics Daily, CNN Politcal Ticker, and
    Mediaite. Off the coast of Liberal Blogs lies the island of NYTimes, off the
    coast of Conservative Blogs is Libertarian Isle. Between the two lies The
    Talk. The northern peninsula of Tech Blogs contains places such as Gizmodo,
    Engadget, Joystiq, and Kotaku.] 

    [Text found between the two insets, which are directly below the main map.]

    measure of a community's current size and health. This updated map uses size
    to represent total social activity in a community -- that is, how much
    talking, playing, sharing, or other socializing happens there. This meant
    some comparing of apples and oranges, but I did my best and tried to be
    consistent.

    Estimates are based on the numbers I could find, but involved a great deal
    of guesswork, statistical inference, random sampling, nonrandom sampling, a
    20,000-cell spreadsheet, emailing, cajoling, tea-leaf reading, goat
    sacrifices, and gut instinct (i.e. making things up).

    Sources of data include Google and Bing, Wikipedia, Alexa, Big-Boards.com,
    StumbleUpon, Wordpress, Akismet, every website statistics page I could find,
    press releases, news articles, and individual site employees. Thanks in
    particular to folks at Last.fm, LiveJournal, Reddit, and the New York Times,
    as well as sysadmins at a number of sites who shared statistics on condition
    of anonymity.

    [In a frame-less picture to the left of the first panel there's a picture of
    a cross section of an airfoil (a plane wing), with a small black arrow
    pointing down on the wing from above and similar but larger arrow pointing
    up on the wing from below. Two lines beginning close to each other at the
    right respectively moves over and under the wing ending in arrow heads to
    the left. Just before and after the wing four small lines crossing the long
    arrows indicate approximately where the path of the lines stop being
    parallel. Above the drawing there is a caption. Below, in a speech bubble
    with an arrow pointing towards the next panel to the right, is the text that
    the teacher Miss Lenhart has just used to describe the drawing.]

    Handling a student who challenges your expertise with an insightful
    question:

    Miss Lenhart: So, kids, the air above the wing travels a longer distance, so
    it has to go faster to keep up. Faster air exerts less pressure, so the wing
    is lifted upward.

    [Miss Lenhart is shown standing while a student asks a question from
    off-panel.]

    Student (off-panel): But then why can planes fly upside down?

    [Miss Lenhart is pondering the question. Beat panel. Three long and curved
    arrows point out from the right frame of this panel, leading to each of the
    next three panels which are arranged vertically above each other, making the
    comic much deeper in this column than in the first two.]

    [In the top panel Miss Lenhart turns away from the students taking a hand to
    her chin. Overlaid on the top of the panel there is a small frame with a
    caption:]

    Right:

    Miss Lenhart: Wow, good question! Maybe this picture is simplified - or
    wrong! We should learn more.

    leans a little forward looking more down. Overlaid on the top of the panel

    Cueball: I'm sorry, but this won't get fixed until I talk to an engineer.
    Can you look around for someone wearing cargo pants, maybe a subway map on

    chair at a desk. A phone is hooked up on his table with two wires coming
    out. He is wearing a headset. He leans back in the chair and looks behind
    him to the right. Cueball talks to him over the phone indicated with a

    behind him to the left. He lifts him self up with one hand while the other
    takes the sheet down over his body. The last part it thus drawn outside the

    Partly behind Steve's head is a piece of paper on the wall with a circle
    around a central dot and four arrows pointing in towards the circle from
    each corner of the paper. Behind Hairy's head is another paper with a graph
    that looks like a positive third degree polynomial with three non-zero
    solutions. Between Cueball and Hairy at the level of their hands is a small
    square with two small dots at the two top corners. Seems like a part of the
    wall rather than a paper. During the next images the two on either side of
    Cueball moves their head in front or away from these papers so at least once
    the hole drawing can be seen. Over the panels top frame there is a frame

    In the spirit of xkcd I present a proposal for a new Smithsonian museum:

    The Smithsonian Museum Of Dad-Trolling

    An entire building dedicated to deceiving children for amusement

    (Click to view exhibits!)

    Later, they lose interest.

    Exhibit: A child on his dad's shoulders looks up at a looming statue of
    Jesus behind a lectern. There are flakes falling from Jesus onto them both.

    Exhibit label: Snow is Jesus' dandruff. His scalp gets dry when it's cold.

    Exhibit: A child lies asleep, while hands and a scary face reach up around
    the bed toward him.

    Exhibit label: Sleep: Now you're vulnerable to the boogie man!

    Exhibit label: DNA only has four letters because the alphabet was smaller
    back then.

    Dad, to child: Told you so.

    Exhibit: A bunch of molecules hang from the ceiling.

    Exhibit label: Molecules? In my day, we only had atoms!

    The top right room is 'Regrettable Pranks: An Interactive Experience'. There
    are four exhibits.

    Exhibit: Five balloons float tethered to a table. A child is holding a sixth
    balloon. The Dad looks alarmed.

    Sign on exhibit: If this helium makes your voice go higher, it's because
    you're ten seconds from exploding.

    Exhibit: An alien face is shown above an outline of several hands next to a
    ruler. A child holds his hand up to it.

    Sign on exhibit: Measure your middle finger. If it's longer than the others,
    you're an alien halfbreed.

    Exhibit: Three cups are on a table. A child is walking away with a fourth
    cup, the dad's arm around the child's shoulder.

    Exhibit label: Has anyone seen my rabbit brain? It looks like a cherry, and
    I dropped it in a Jello cup.

    Exhibit: A monstrous set of jaws open upward around a bed.

    Sign on exhibit: Make your bed or monsters will know a kid lives there.

    The center right room is 'Concessions'. There are three booths.

    A dad and child are eating.

    Dad: The "P" is for "phoenix".

    Booth: A concession stand.

    Sign on stand: Ground beef: Beef we found on the ground.

    Dad, to child: Told you.

    Exhibit label: Mommies get big tummies before babies come because the stork

    REVENGE.

    In the areas outside the rooms, there are two more exhibits and restrooms,
    all clickable.

    Exhibit: A dinosaur skeleton.

    Exhibit label: That's right. Dinosaurs were made entirely of BONES.

    Dad, to kid: If you think about it, it makes sense.

    Exhibit: A large image hangs on the wall. It is a dense squiggly jumble of

    mountains, Sam saw a white star twinkle for a while. The beauty of it smote
    his heart, as he looked up out of the forsaken land, and hope returned to
    him. For like a shaft, clear and cold, the thought pierced him that in the
    end the shadow was only a small and passing thing: There was light and high

    Cueball: Help!

    [Ponytail, a 911 operator is in an office, wearing a headset.]

    Ponytail: Splotches of light? Your... eyeballs?

    Cueball (over phone): I think that's what they are! There's meat everywhere!

    Ponytail: ...so you're a brain.

    Cueball (over phone): Yes!

    Ponytail: Yeah, we all are. You're not trapped. Use your body to walk around
    and experience reality.

    Cueball: But everything's just signals in my sensory cortices! How can I be
    sure they correspond to an external world?!

    [Ponytail and Cueball are discussing science. They are interrupted by an
    off-panel shout.]

    Ponytail: The problem with scientists is that you take the wonder and beauty
    out of everything by trying to analyze it.

    Megan (off panel): Dude!

    [Megan runs across this frame less panel, carrying a microscope and a yellow
    slime mold.]

    Megan: My plasmoidal slime molds have heightened pigment production! Check
    out that yellow color! That actually makes them zinc-resistant. Amazing,
    huh?

    [A close up of Megan's hands holding the yellow slime mold up to Ponytail
    who takes her hands up to her mouth.]

    Ponytail: It looks like dog barf.

    Megan (off panel): Hah, yeah! F. Septica is nicknamed "dog vomit slime
    mold." Cool, huh? Check out my slides!

    [Megan has set down the microscope on the floor of the panel, and the slime
    mold is jiggling in her hands, while Cueball watches but Ponytail looks
    away.]

    Ponytail: Okay, never mind: What's wrong with scientists is that you do see
    wonder and beauty in everything.

    page argument over whether the 1/87.0857143 scale is called "HO" or "H0", or

    extremely strong opinion on the issue.

  transcript: >
    [Cueball to the left and his friend, who also looks like Cueball, are
    standing in the friend's rather large basement, where the celling is held up
    by six thin columns, and the walls are shown angling in towards a point of
    perspective, to display how big the room is.]

    Friend: I want to build a perfect HO-scale (~1/87) model train layout of my
    town.

    Cueball: In your basement? Bad idea. Never make a layout of the area you're
    in.

    [Zoom in on the two friends without the basement visualized.]

    Friend: Why not?

    Cueball: Because it'd include a little 10" replica of your house.

    [Zoom in Cueball's friend who takes his hand to his chin.]

    Friend: So? That's be cool! I'd make tiny replicas of my rooms, my
    furniture—

    Cueball (off-screen)l: —And your train layout?

    [Beneath this first row of the comic is the zoom-out of how the full model
    would look in the basement. The town lies beneath some small mountains.
    There is some water with a bridge over it continuing to the roads going
    through the city. There is no frame around this section, but instead there
    follows five zoom-outs, each one going from the friend's house, that
    proceeds to a circular frame. Within each of these is shown a nested model.
    Starting to the right of the main model, and then moving down, then left,
    and then down and right. Each layer has a broken arrow above the model
    between two vertical lines to indicate the scale, the length being written
    between the two parts of the arrow. Some foreign objects are also labeled to
    help understand the scale.]

    [Layer 1, the model with the two friends standing to the left of it.]

    18 m

    [Layer 2, looks exactly as the model, but without the friends.]

    21 cm

    [Layer 3, with a mosquito shown for comparison. It stands over half the
    model covering the mountains.]

    2.4 mm 

    [Layer 4, with a strand of spider silk (labeled) shown for comparison. The
    silk is much thicker than the roads, almost as thick as the mountains and
    much longer than the model. But the model still looks fairly much like the
    original one.]

    28 μm

    Spider web

    [Layer 5, with a cold virus (labeled) shown for comparison. It covers
    roughly a quarter of the model, taking up the water part of the model. At
    this level the whole model becomes notably "fuzzy" as individual atoms are
    discernible, and most of the features apart from the mountain is
    indiscernible. There may be two viruses. The other would then be to the
    right of the one in the water but above the model. The label stands between
    them.]

    320 nm

    Cold virus 

    [Layer 6, is simply spheres (atoms) at this point. The mountain near the
    back is the only noticeable feature, consisting of five atoms jutting out
    from the surface of atoms, which is by now mean flat, but has no other
    features than the mountain.]

    37 Å 

    [Beneath these six versions of the model is a caption:]

    The Matryoshka limit: 

    It is impossible to nest 

    more than six HO layouts

    [Back to the two friends in the basement, still not showing the basement.]

    Friend: My God.

    Cueball: Yeah. It's the second rule of model train layouts: No nesting.

    [Zoom in on the heads of the two friends.]

    Friend: ...What's the first rule?

    Cueball: "Do not talk about model train layouts." That rule was actually
    voted in by our friends and families.

    Friend: Philistines.

    working with these samples. A voice comes from off-panel (and is revealed in
    the next panels to be Zombie Marie Curie.]

    Ponytail: My teacher always told me that if I applied myself, I could become
    the next Marie Curie.

    Zombie Marie Curie (off-panel): You know, I wish they'd get over me.

    walking towards Ponytail in typical zombie fashion both arms stretched out,

    presumably mainly earth from when she dug herself out of her grave, and she
    is leaving a trail of this behind her, and it keeps falling from both of her
    hands and her body.]

    decorative. But I make a sorry role model if girls just see me over and over
    as the one token lady scientist.

    hair bun keeping it in place.]

    Zombie Marie Curie: Lise Meitner figured out that nuclear fission was
    happening, while her colleague Otto was staring blankly at their data in
    confusion, and proved Enrico Fermi wrong in the process. Enrico and Otto
    both got Nobel Prizes. Lise got a National Women's Press Club award.

    60 years later.

    finishing-school upbringing, pursued mathematics by auditing classes, and,
    after finally getting a Ph.D, was permitted to teach only as an unpaid
    lecturer (often under male colleagues' names).

    Ponytail: Was she as good as them?

    Zombie Marie Curie: She revolutionized abstract algebra, filled gaps in
    relativity, and found what some call the most beautiful, deepest result in
    theoretical physics.

    Ponytail: Oh.

    [Close up of Zombie Marie Curie.]

    Zombie Marie Curie: But you don't become great by trying to be great. You
    become great by wanting to do something, and then doing it so hard that you
    become great in the process.

    [Zoom out to both Ponytail and Zombie Marie Curie.]

    Zombie Marie Curie: So don't try to be the next me, Noether, or Meitner.
    Just remember that if you want to do this stuff, you're not alone.

    Cueball: But that's true of anything! Wine, house music, fonts, ants,

    boring, but in #415, the way the man's jaw frames the mayo on his hand is
    pure perfection, and—

    Voice (from right side of the box): What a surprise- you praising a mayo
    frame. Listening to you, I'd think there was nothing else in The Sandwich.

    [Cueball holds a cellphone. Black Hat is sitting at a desk with a laptop.]

    Cueball: Another huge study found no evidence that cell phones cause cancer.
    What was the W.H.O. thinking?

    Black Hat: I think they just got it backward.

    [Black Hat turns towards Cueball, holding the laptop with one hand by the
    upper edge of the screen.]

    Cueball: Huh?

    Black Hat: Well, take a look.

    [There is a plot of total cancer incidence and cell phone users. Cancer
    rises from 1970 to 1990, then stays relatively steady. Cell phone use rises
    from roughly 1984, and steeply after 1990, to the present.]

    Cueball: You're not... There are so many problems with that.

    Black Hat: Just to be safe, until I see more data I'm going to assume cancer
    causes cell phones.

    Friend: Huh? What do you mean?

    [The panel zooms in on the Cueball's face. The friends reply comes from
    off-panel.]

    Cueball: They live for millennia and use little energy. They can slow down
    their internal clocks so time speeds past. To hunt, they lock on to some
    prey, and when it stops moving, they eat it.

    Friend (off-panel): But what if the prey doesn't die?

    [Zoom out to Cueball and his friend that now look at each other.]

    Each curve is normalized to have the same number of total hits - they're not

    Friend: Well, did the treatment work?

    Cueball: We don't know.

    [Cueball's next few lines are set by themselves in their own panels,
    arranged around a larger image.]

    Cueball: I always assumed that when you got cancer, they gave you a
    prognosis, then treated you, and at the end of treatment either you beat it
    or you died.

    [The diagram shows a simple highway. Starting at the bottom, with diagnosis
    for five lanes, the road travels through a cloud of treatment, after which
    two lanes disappear, and three continue. Later on, there's another off-ramp
    labeled 'cancer "comes back"', which loops back into the treatment cloud.
    Otherwise, the highway enters a later cloud called survive.]

    Cueball: And I knew sometimes it "recurred," which I assumed meant back to
    square one.

    Cueball: But that's turned out not to be quite right.

    [Back to Cueball and his friend.]

    Cueball: Once most cancers spread out into your body, they're incurable.

    Cueball: If your 10-year prognosis is 60%, that means a 40% chance that some
    cancer will slip past the treatment and get out.

    [The frame zooms in to show just Cueball.]

    Cueball: So they kill all the cancer they can find, and then you're a
    "survivor." But your odds are still 60%.

    [The panel zooms in further, now showing only Cueball's top half.]

    Cueball: They can't scan for individual cancer cells. The only way to know
    if it worked is to wait for tumors to pop up elsewhere.

    Cueball: If you go enough years without that happening then you were in the
    60%.

    [The frame shows both people again.]

    Cueball: And often the first sign is a cough or bone pain.

    Cueball: So you spend the next five or ten years trying not to worry that
    every ache and pain is the answer to the question "Do I make it?"

    [There's an extra large panel, with a small one floating inside it.]

    [The panel shows fifty-two lanes emerging from the cloud of 'Treatment'.
    Signs show 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years, 6 years. Lanes branch
    off and fade into darkness earlier on the right, with some lanes continuing
    off the top of the panel.]

    The comic illustrates the relative strength of passwords assuming basic
    knowledge of the system used to generate them.

    A set of boxes is used to indicate how many bits of entropy a section of the
    password provides.

    The comic is laid out with 6 panels arranged in a 3x2 grid.

    On each row, the first panel explains the breakdown of a password, the
    second panel shows how long it would take for a computer to guess, and the
    third panel provides an example scene showing someone trying to remember the
    password.

    [The password "Tr0ub4dor&3" is shown in the center of the panel. A line from
    each annotation indicates the word section the comment applies to.]

    Uncommon (non-gibberish) base word

    [Highlighting the base word - 16 bits of entropy.]

    Caps?

    [Highlighting the first letter - 1 bit of entropy.]

    Common Substitutions

    [Highlighting the letters 'a' (substituted by '4') and both 'o's (the first
    of which is substituted by '0') - 3 bits of entropy.]

    Punctuation

    [Highlighting the symbol appended to the word - 4 bits of entropy.]

    Numeral

    [Highlighting the number appended to the word - 3 bits of entropy.]

    Order unknown

    [Highlighting the appended characters - 1 bit of entropy.]

    (You can add a few more bits to account for the fact that this is only one
    of a few common formats.)

    ~28 bits of entropy 

    228 = 3 days at 1000 guesses/sec

    (Plausible attack on a weak remote web service. Yes, cracking a stolen hash
    is faster, but it's not what the average user should worry about.)

    Difficulty to guess: Easy

    [Cueball stands scratching his head trying to remember the password.]

    Cueball: Was it trombone? No, Troubador. And one of the O's was a zero?

    Cueball: And there was some symbol...

    Difficulty to remember: Hard

    [The passphrase "correct horse battery staple" is shown in the center of the
    panel.]

    Four random common words {Each word has 11 bits of entropy.}

    ~44 bits of entropy

    244 = 550 years at 1000 guesses/sec

    Difficulty to guess: Hard

    [Cueball is thinking, in his thought bubble a horse is standing to one side
    talking to an off-screen observer. An arrow points to a staple attached to
    the side of a battery.]

    Horse: That's a battery staple.

    Observer: Correct!

    Difficulty to remember: You've already memorized it

    Through 20 years of effort, we've successfully trained everyone to use
    passwords that are hard for humans to remember, but easy for computers to

    The middle part is frame-less and only has text - the only narrating not
    inside one of the frames. Then at the bottom there are two frames overlaid
    over three small panels in a row]

    [In the top part of the 2ns panel stands Cueball on a flat disk inside a
    hemispherical dome with the front half cut away. The dome is about three
    times as tall as Cueball. Above the dome there is one frame with text. There
    is also two labeled arrows pointing to the dome and the disk.]

    Stars are the same way.

    Arrow up: Sky

    Arrow down: Ground 


    [Text in between the top and the bottom panels:]

    I know they're scattered through and endless ocean, but my gut insists
    they're a painting on a domed ceiling.

    [The next two frames with text is overlaid above (three lines of text) and
    below (one line of text) the three panels described first. Those three
    panels are all inverted with black background and white Cueball:]

    [Left panel: Cueball stands on a curved surface, looking up.]

    [Middle panel: The perspective of the scene shifts, suddenly the surface
    Cueball is standing on is in the top left of the panel. Cueball is now
    looking down, leaning back, and waving his arms trying to regain balance.

    [Right panel: The perspective of the scene returns to normal, Cueball is now
    semi-crouched, staring at the ground with legs spaced apart to help him
    balance.]

    If I try hard enough, I get a glimmer of depth, a dizzying sense of space,

    But then everything snaps back.

    [An American football field is shown with Cueball drawn very small near the
    middle. Sections at the left tips of each of the goal posts are highlighted
    and shown as a zoomed view in an insert box. These insert shows the two
    webcams mounted on the top of the very tip, one for each goal posts. There
    are two frames with text above the field, the top one most to the left with
    one line, the second directly below it with two lines, and below the field
    there is also one frame with one line in it.]

    So one summer afternoon

    I set up two HD webcams hundreds of feet apart,

    Pointed them at the sky,

    [The next two frames with two lines of text each are stretched over the two
    middle panels in this second row of panels:]

    [The first panel shows a pair of glasses and a smartphone with an attachment
    designed to clip onto the glasses. The smartphone screen is setup to display
    two images side by side such that one camera is visible in the left half of
    the screen, and the other camera is visible in the right half of the screen.
    There are four arrows pointing to the two items and to each of the two parts
    of the screen. They all have labels which are between the two lines of text,
    but here shown below for clarity.]

    [The next panel shows the completed phone glasses assembly.]

    And fed one stream to each of my eyes.

    The parallax expanded my depth perception by a thousand times,

    Arrow top left: Right camera

    Arrow top right: Smartphone

    Arrow bottom left: Very strong reading glasses

    Arrow bottom right: Left camera


    [Cueball stands wearing the phone glasses assembly, one hand held up to the
    device, staring into the sky. There are two frames one above and one below
    with two lines of text each:]

    And I stood in my living room

    At the bottom of an abyss

    [Another colored panel with blue sky and clouds below the top part of the
    panel from left to right. Cueball is now a giant who stands in the middle of
    the frame on the shore of a coastline with a small island off the coast,
    only a step away for him. A city is near his right foot and the tallest
    skyscraper appears ankle high. A mountain range is behind him with mountains
    that are also only barely ankle high. A river flows past the mountains and
    joins another coming from them on it's way down towards the coast. Cueball
    is standing with his head well above cloud level as clouds swim around him.
    At the top above and left of his head the last frame with one line of text
    is located:]

    What your favorite

    Map Projection

    says about you

    [All of these are organized as Title, a copy of the particular projection
    underneath, and what it says about you under that.]

    Mercator

    You're not really into maps.


    Van der Grinten

    You're not a complicated person. You love the Mercator projection; you just
    wish it weren't square. The Earth's not a square, it's a circle. You like
    circles. Today is gonna be a good day!


    Robinson

    You have a comfortable pair of running shoes that you wear everywhere. You
    like coffee and enjoy The Beatles. You think the Robinson is the
    best-looking projection, hands down.


    Dymaxion

    You like Isaac Asimov, XML, and shoes with toes. You think the Segway got a
    bad rap. You own 3D goggles, which you use to view rotating models of better
    3D goggles. You type in Dvorak.


    Winkel-Tripel

    National Geographic adopted the Winkel-Tripel in 1998, but you've been a W-T
    fan since long before "Nat Geo" showed up. You're worried it's getting
    played out, and are thinking of switching to the Kavrayskiy. You once left a
    party in disgust when a guest showed up wearing shoes with toes. Your
    favorite musical genre is "Post–".


    Goode Homolosine

    They say mapping the Earth on a 2D surface is like flattening an orange
    peel, which seems enough to you. You like easy solutions.You think we
    wouldn't have so many problems if we'd just elect normal people to Congress
    instead of Politicians. You think airlines should just buy food from the
    restaurants near the gates and serve that on board. You change your car's
    oil, but secretly wonder if you really need to.


    Hobo-Dyer

    You want to avoid cultural imperialism, but you've heard bad things about
    Gall-Peters. You're conflict-averse and buy organic. You use a
    recently-invented set of gender-neutral pronouns and think that what the
    world needs is a revolution in consciousness.


    Plate Carrée (Equirectangular)

    You think this one is fine. You like how X and Y map to latitude and
    longitude. The other projections overcomplicate things. You want me to stop
    asking about maps so you can enjoy dinner.


    A Globe!

    Yes, you're very clever.


    Waterman Butterfly

    Really? You know the Waterman? Have you seen the 1909 Cahill Map it's based—
    ...You have a framed reproduction at home?! Whoa. ...Listen, forget these
    questions. Are you doing anything tonight?


    Peirce Quincuncial

    You think that when we look at a map, what we really see is ourselves. After
    you first saw Inception, you sat silent in the theater for six hours. It
    freaks you out to realize that everyone around you has a skeleton inside
    them. You have really looked at your hands.


    Gall-Peters

    I hate you.

    Cueball: Earthquake!

    Ponytail: We should get to a higher ground - There could be a tidal wave.

    [Cueball takes a pedantic pose]

    Cueball: You mean a tsunami. "Tidal wave" means a wave caused by tides.

    [A crash is heard, followed by Etymology-Man flying in while wearing a
    cape.]

    Etymology-man: You know, that doesn't add up.

    Cueball and Ponytail: Etymology-man!

    [Etymology-man takes a pedantic pose.]

    Etymology-man: What does "tidal wave" mean? There are waves caused by tides,
    but they're "tidal bores", and they're not cataclysmic.

    It can refer to the daily tide cycle, but that's obviously not what people
    mean when they say "a tidal wave hit".

    It's been obvious for centuries that these waves come from quakes. So why
    "tidal"?

    Etymology-man: Remember that until 2004, there weren't any clear photos or
    videos of tsunamis. Some modern writers even described them rearing up and
    breaking like surfing waves.

    Of course, in 2004 and 2011, it was made clear to everyone that a tsunami is
    more like a rapid, turbulent, inrushing tide - exactly what historical
    accounts describe.

    [Water begins to rush in. Etymology-man keeps his pedantic pose.]

    Etymology-man: Maybe those writing about Lisbon in 1755 used "tidal wave"
    not out of scientific confusion, but because it described the wave's form —
    a description lost in our rush to expunge "tidal wave" from English.

    [The water is now waist-deep. Etymology-man continues to drone on, but the
    others start to panic.]

    Etymology-man: "Tsunami" is now the standard, and I'm not trying to change
    that. But let's be a tad less giddy about correcting "tidal wave" -
    especially when "tsunami" just means "harbor wave", which is hardly...

  transcript: >
    When I have a boring task to get through — a three-hour lecture, a giant
    file download, or a long term point goal in fitocracy — I use this formula
    to convert the percentage completed (p) into a date:

    T=(Current Date) - (e^(20.3444*p^3+3) - e^3) years

    When the task is 0% done, it gives today's date, and as I make progress, I
    move further and further back in time

    (inverse given in lighter colors)

    Inverse: p = sqrt((ln(T+e^3)-3)/20.3444)

    [Line Graph explaining the correlation between completion percentages and
    temporal deltas.

    0% = now (Date of comic is 2012-02-14T00:00-0500, approx. 1329195600 UNIX)

    90% = 55 million years ago

    100% = 13.8 billion years ago

    ]

    It moves slowly through the first few years, then steadily accelerates. I
    tuned the formula so the time spent in each part of the past is loosely
    proportional to how well I know it. This means I hit familiar landmarks with
    each bit of progress, giving me a satisfying sense of movement.

    periods, and notable events from this time period.]

    [Two Cadbury eggs, one in the foil, the other out of the foil and broken

    A Cadbury egg has about 20g of sugar. (25g outside the US.) "One Cadbury
    Egg" is a nice unit of sugar content.

    [A can of soda with an equals sign and two eggs; a bottle of soda with an
    equals sign and three eggs.]

    One 12oz. can of soda has about two Cadbury eggs worth of sugar. One 20oz.
    bottle has three.

    [Two unwrapped Cadbury eggs, with an arrow indicating they should be placed
    in a glass of water.]

    One Cadbury egg is enough to make me feel kinda gross. Now when I see Coke
    or Snapple or Nestea or whatever, I imagine drinking a couple of dissolved
    Cadbury eggs.

    [Megan puts her hand to her chin in thought, Cueball has his arms out in
    exclamation.]

    Megan: Wow. Huh. So the takeaway is... I can eat Cadbury eggs by the handful
    all season and feel no worse about it than I do about soda?

    Cueball: That's not really—

    on a table in front of them. There is another table behind them with another
    lamp and next to it stands a box with a picture of yet a different type of
    lamp in the bottom right corner. Both lamps have a prize tag dangling from
    their shade. Above them (and their spoken text) is a frame with a caption:]

    Megan: It's got 1½ stars on Amazon. Reviews all say to avoid that brand.

    [To the left of Cueball there is another lamp on a table. But he is now
    looking at his smartphone instead. Megan has turned away from him but is
    also looking at her smartphones. There are no lamps next to her.]

    Cueball: This one has good reviews.

    Megan: Wait, one guy says when he plugged it in, he got a metallic taste in
    his mouth and his cats went deaf.

    Cueball: Eek. 

    Cueball: What about- ...no, review points out it resembles a uterus.

    [Cueball is holding hos smartphone up in front of his face, Megan, looking
    at him, is holding her smartphone but has her arms down. There are no lamps
    shown.]

    Cueball: OK, I found a Swiss lampmaker with perfect reviews. Her lamps start

    [A line graph with four lines, each representing 'Google Trends Search
    Volume' of different search terms over time from prior to 2005 to just after
    2012. A blue line represents "blog," which trends gradually but
    significantly upwards from well before 2005 until it reaches a peak between
    2008-2009, and starts to very slowly descend to today. A red line represents
    "Tumblr", which is at zero until it slowly starts to trend upward in early
    2010, and then sharply increases in late 2010 and through 2011 and 2012. As
    of the date of this comic, 'blog' still beats 'Tumblr' in terms of search
    volume, but a dotted line projection of the trend shows that on October 12,
    2012, the two lines will cross. A yellow line represents 'Wordpress,' which
    has very low volume until a very small and gradual increase in 2007, which
    gradually increases to this day but doesn't come close to meeting the volume
    of either 'blog' or 'Tumblr'. A green line represents 'LiveJournal,' which
    started out prior to 2005 at around the level 'Wordpress' is at now, but
    declined through 2005 and 2006 until it has plateaued until virtually
    nothing.]

    Cueball: Have you tried SwiftKey? It's got the first decent language model
    I've seen. It learns from your SMS/Email archives what words you use
    together most often.

    Cueball: Spacebar inserts its best guess. So if I type "The Empi" and hit
    space three times, it types "The Empire Strikes Back".

    Cueball: I guess it fills in your most likely first word, then the word that

    Your Central Visual Field

    [This comic contains numerous visual elements arranged around a central
    point, and are intended to represent locations in a sphere with the eyeball
    as the center. Underlaid below all of the elements are concentric circles
    representing degrees from straight ahead, using the eyeball's point of view,
    denoting where these elements would appear in someone's field of vision
    given proper setup. For this description, elements will be described using
    this grid plus location in degrees within the specified circle, placing 0
    degrees to the right and going counterclockwise, separated with the word
    "mark".]

    [At the top are the instructions to view this page]

    Look at the center with your eyes this far from the screen.

    [A rolled-up sheet of paper that equals about 55 total horizontal degrees in
    width in the measurement of the chart.]

    (You can roll up a sheet of paper and cut it - or zoom the page - so it
    matches this image)

    17 mark 0: right eye blind spot.

    from 0 to 30 mark 15:

    [The same image, increasing in absolute size from a very tiny object in the
    center to one about 20x original size at 30 degrees.]

    Detail - We only see at high resolution over a small area in the center of
    our vision where retinal cells are densest (the fovea). If you stare at the
    center of this chart, your eyes are seeing all these panels at roughly the
    same level of detail.

    9 mark 105: Moon.

    7 mark 112: Supermoon.

    from 0 to 20 mark 170:

    [Sets 3 partially overlapping circles in multiple locations along this path.
    Each set has a primary color in each circle and additive colors in the
    overlap areas, with color saturation decreasing sharply as the sets leave
    the center.]

    Color Vision: We don't see much color outside the center of our vision - our
    brains keep track of what color things are and fill it in for us.

    17 mark 180: Left Eye Blind Spot.

    (not pictured: T-Boz blind spot, Chilli blind spot)

    From 0 to infinity mark from 180 to 205:

    [A swath of blue, with heavier saturation up to 5 degrees from center to
    fading, but never gone out to the edges of the image.]

    From 0 to 7 from 205 to 235:

    [A swath of red, with full saturation in the center and fading out
    completely at 7 degrees from center.]

    From 0 to 7 from 235 to 270:

    [A swath of green, with full saturation in the center and fading out
    completely at 7 degrees from center.]

    Red and green-sensitive cones are mainly limited to the center of our
    vision. We have few blue-sensitive cone cells, but they're found out to the
    edge of our vision.

    25 mark 205: [A small whisp of white in a swath of blue.]

    Blue-sky sprites: These tiny, darting spots, visible against smooth blue
    backgrounds, are white cells moving in the blood vessels over the retina

    5 mark 195:

    [A long blob, slightly distorting the blue swath.]

    Floaters: Some types of floaters are caused by breakdown of your eyeball
    goop as you age, but this type is some other kind of debris near the retina.
    I don't know what.

    10 mark 270:

    [An askew crosshair and circle, with faint blue and yellow wedges inside]

    Humans can see polarization - Stare at a white area on an LCD display while
    rotating it or your head fast (use straight ahead as the axis of rotation).

    Polarization direction is shown by a faint central yellow blue shape (Also
    visible in deep blue skies)

    from 0 to 30 mark 340:

    [The same image, increasing in absolute size from a very tiny object in the
    center to one about 20x original size at 30 degrees. The brightness of the
    image varies from black at 2 mark 340, to gray at 5 mark 340, to nearly
    white at 10 mark 340, to slightly grayer at 20 mark 340, to medium gray at
    30 mark 340.]

    Night Vision: Cone cells (sharp, central color vision) don't work in low
    light, but rod cells (monochrome, low-res, non-central) do. This is why you
    can walk around in dim light, but not read. It's also why you can spot
    fainter stars by looking next to them.

  transcript: "THE SAGA OF EPSILON AND ZETA\nThe 2005 Atlantic hurricane season saw devastating storms like Katrina and Rita. But less well-remembered is just how strange the season got toward the end.\nThe forecasters at the National Hurricane Center are the best of the best.\nTheir predictions are masterpieces of professional analysis. But in November 2005, out in the center of the Atlantic — far from any land — the atmosphere stopped making sense.\nAnd the forecasters — who'd expected the season to be long over by now — started to get a little\N...unhinged.\nThis is their story, as seen through the actual 2005 NHC Advisories:\n[Two men, one bald and one not, sit looking at their respective computers, at separate desks, back to back. The advisory is printed above them in caps small-caps Courier type.]\nTuesday, November 29th, 2005: Tropical Storm Epsilon ... The 26th named storm of the apparently never ending 2005 Atlantic hurricane season.\n[The same scene, different text.]\n10 PM Wed: The window of opportunity for strengthening should close in 12-24 hr. 4 PM Thu: Slow but steady weakening is expected to begin in 12-24 hours.\n[The man with hair now has questions marks above his head.]\n4 AM Fri: Epsilon does not appear weaker. 10 AM Fri: Epsilon has been upgraded to a 65-kt hurricane.\n[The two still sit back-to-back.]\n4 PM Sat: Epsilon has continued to strengthen against all odds ... [but] can not maintain the current intensity much longer since the environment is becoming increasingly unfavorable.\n[The two still sit back-to-back.]\n10 PM Sat: Epsilon might or might not still be a hurricane ... but in any case it likely will not be one on Sunday. 4 AM Sun: Epsilon is downgraded to a tropical storm.\n[The two still sit back-to-back. The man with hair's fists are clenched.]\_:10 AM Sun: Morning satellite images indicate that Epsilon has restrengthened.\n[A closer view of just the balding man at his desk.]\nThere are no clear reasons ... and I am not going to make one up ... to explain the recent strengthening of Epsilon and I am just describing the facts. However ... I still have to make an intensity forecast and the best bet at this time is to predict weakening ... Epsilon will likely become a remnant low. I heard that before about epsilon ... haven't you?\n[The two men still sit back to back, but the man with hair is now turning his head toward the other man, with his arm resting on the back of his chair. The bald man is leaning forward in his seat, toward his computer while typing.]\n4 PM Mon: The cloud pattern continues to be remarkably well-organized for a hurricane at such high latitude in December.\n[The other man has turned back to his own screen.]\n10 PM Mon: We have said this before ... but Epsilon really does not appear as strong this evening as it did this afternoon.\n[Just the bald guy now.]\n4 AM Tue: I have run out of things to say.\n[The two of them again.]\n10 PM Tue: The end is in sight. It really really is. But in the meantime ... Epsilon continues to maintain hurricane status. 4 AM Wed: The end is in sight ... yes ... but not quiet yet. I thought I was going to find a weakening system and instead I found that Epsilon is still a hurricane.\n[The two of them still.]\n10 AM Thu: Convection has vanished and Epsilon is now a tight swirl of low clouds.

    A history of

    The United States Congress

    Partisan and ideological makeup

    [The comic is divided into three massive sections, SENATE, PRESIDENCIES, and
    HOUSE. Timelines run backwards down the page between each section. In the
    HOUSE and SENATE sections, shifting, curving red and blue areas of different
    brightness illustrate the shifting balance of power between "Members of
    Left-Leaning Parties" and "Members of Right-Leaning Parties". Under
    PRESIDENCIES, different administrations are labeled and wars are shaded in
    gray. There are notes throughout all sections.]

    [There are additional notes on the right.]

    LEGEND

    [Square containing ribbons of color merging upwards with larger areas]:
    Branches join in when new members enter Congress and cause an ideological
    bloc to grow. (Note: If the new member is elected as another retires from
    the same ideological bloc, no change is shown.)

    [Square containing ribbons of color splitting off from larger areas]:
    Branches split off when members leave Congress, causing their ideological
    bloc to shrink. (Note: If the new member is elected as another retires from
    the same ideological bloc, no change is shown.)

    [Square showing yellow dotted line crossing from red to blue area]: The
    yellow line marks the midpoint, which indicates which side has control of
    the chamber.

    [Square in which curve briefly separates from blue area]: If a bloc loses
    members in one election and gains them in the next, the exiting stream may
    rejoin. This does not necessarily mean the same people returned.

    [Square showing white dashed line labeled Lyndon Johnson on top of ribbon
    merging with main area]: Future (and past) US Presidents who served in
    Congress are shown with white dashed lines. Other noteworthy members are
    shown with thin solid lines.

    [Square in which tinted area marked "Whig" sits over mix of red and blue
    areas]: Tinted white outlines mark the approximate membership of some of the
    smaller political parties.


    HOW IDEOLOGY IS CALCULATED

    Each member of Congress is assigned to an ideological category using
    DW-NOMINATE, a statistical system created by political scientists Keith
    Poole and Howard Rosenthal. This system rates each member of Congress's
    ideological position [sic] based on their votes.

    DW-NOMINATE is purely mathematical and involves no judgement on the content
    of bills. Instead, members of Congress are placed on a spectrum based on how
    consistently they vote together.

    While people argue that ideology is many-dimensional, Poole and Rosenthal
    found that nearly all Congressional voting behavior - especially in the
    modern era - can be accurately predicted by using just one ideological
    variable.

    This variable turns out to roughly correspond to position on the classic
    economic liberal/conservative spectrum.

    Because members of Congress have served in overlapping terms with past
    members in a chain back to the first Congress, the system allows comparison
    of ideology across time - even accounting for individual members'
    ideological drift. (Note: Scores are comparable across time but not between
    chambers.)

    For more detail, see Poole and Rosenthal's website, voteview.com.

    string attached to a nail above the counter. The picture depicts either a
    setting sun reflecting in an ocean, or an exploding volcano with lava
    flowing away from it. The picture does not block the left most part of the
    frame around the counter, and it is also possible to see the two left-most
    lines of the first digit on the countdown, so they are both turned on. This
    proves that the numbers goes all the way to the left end. The next five
    digits are covered by the picture. Then one digit is only partly covered, as
    only the two most left lines are not visible. From the visible lines it is
    though clear that this digit shows a 0. The next seven digits are fully

    Cueball: Oh, jeez. Probably.

    Cueball: Because all my friends did.

    Cueball: Think about it — which scenario is more likely:

    Cueball: Every single person I know, many of them levelheaded and afraid of
    heights, abruptly went crazy at exactly the same time...

    Cueball: ...or the bridge is on fire?

    The art of letter-writing is fast dying out. When a letter cost nine pence,
    it seemed but fair to try to make it worth nine pence ... Now, however, we
    think we are too busy for such old-fashioned correspondence. We fire off a
    multitude of rapid and short notes, instead of sitting down to have a good
    talk over a real sheet of paper.

    The Sunday Magazine

    1871



    It is, unfortunately, one of the chief characteristics of modern business to
    be always in a hurry. In olden times it was different.

    The Medical Record

    1884



    With the advent of cheap newspapers and superior means of locomotion... The
    dreamy quiet old days are over... For men now live think and work at express
    speed. They have their Mercury or Post laid on their breakfast table in the
    early morning, and if they are too hurried to snatch from it the news during
    that meal, they carry it off, to be sulkily read as they travel ... leaving
    them no time to talk with the friend who may share the compartment with
    them... The hurry and bustle of modern life ... lacks the quiet and repose
    of the period when our forefathers, the day's work done, took their ease...

    William Smith, Morley: Ancient and Modern

    1886



    Conversation is said to be a lost art ... Good talk presupposes leisure,
    both for preparation and enjoyment. The age of leisure is dead, and the art
    of conversation is dying.

    Frank Leslie's popular Monthly, Volume 29

    1890



    Intellectual laziness and the hurry of the age have produced a craving for
    literary nips. The torpid brain ... has grown too weak for sustained
    thought.

    There never was an age in which so many people were able to write badly.

    Israel Zangwill, The Bachelors' Club

    1891



    The art of pure line engraving is dying out. We live at too fast a rate to
    allow for the preparation of such plates as our fathers appreciated. If a
    picture catches the public fancy, the public must have an etched or a
    photogravured copy of it within a month or two of its appearance, the days
    when engravers were wont to spend two or three years over a single plate are
    for ever gone.

    Journal of the Institute of Jamaica, Volume 1

    1892



    So much is exhibited to the eye that nothing is left to the imagination. It
    sometimes seems almost possible that the modern world might be choked by its
    own riches, and human faculty dwindle away amid the million inventions that
    have been introduced to render its exercise unnecessary.

    The articles in the Quarterlies extend to thirty or more pages, but thirty
    pages is now too much so we witness a further condensing process and, we
    have the Fortnightly and the Contemporary which reduce thirty pages to
    fifteen pages so that you may read a larger number of articles in a shorter
    time and in a shorter form. As if this last condensing process were not
    enough the condensed articles of these periodicals are further condensed by
    the daily papers, which will give you a summary of the summary of all that
    has been written about everything.

    Those who are dipping into so many subjects and gathering information in a
    summary and superficial form lose the habit of settling down to great works.

    Ephemeral literature is driving out the great classics of the present and
    the past ... hurried reading can never be good reading.

    G. J. Goschen, First Annual Address to the Students, Toynbee Hall. London

    1894



    The existence of mental and nervous degeneration among a growing class of
    people, especially in large cities, is an obvious phenomenon ... the mania
    for stimulants ... diseases of the mind are almost as numerous as the
    diseases of the body... This intellectual condition is characterized by a
    brain incapable of normal working ... in a large measure due to the hurry
    and excitement of modern life, with its facilities for rapid locomotion and
    almost instantaneous communication between remote points of the globe...

    The Churchman, Volume 71

    1895



    If we teach the children how to play and encourage them in their sports ...
    instead of shutting them in badly ventilated schoolrooms, the next
    generation will be more joyous and will be healthier than the present one.

    Public Opinion: A Comprehensive Summary of the Press Throughout the World,
    Volume 18

    1895



    The cause of the ... increase in nervous disease is increased demand made by
    the conditions of modern life upon the brain. Everything is done in a hurry.
    We talk across a continent, telegraph across an ocean, take a trip to
    Chicago for an hour's talk... We take even our pleasures sadly and make a
    task of our play ... what wonder if the pressure is almost more than our
    nerves can bear.

    G. Shrady (from P.C. Knapp)

    "Are nervous diseases increasing?" Medical Record

    1896



    The managers of sensational newspapers ... do not try to educate their
    readers and make them better, but tend to create perverted tastes and
    develop vicious tendencies. The owners of these papers seem to have but one
    purpose, and that is to increase their circulation.

    Medical Brief, Volume 26

    1898



    To take sufficient time for our meals seems frequently impossible on account
    of the demands on our time made by our business... We act on the apparent
    belief that all of our business is so pressing that we must jump on the
    quickest car home, eat our dinner in the most hurried way, make the closest
    connection for a car returning ...

    Louis John Rettger. Studies in Advanced Physiology

    1898



    In these days of increasing rapid artificial locomotion, may I be permitted
    to say a word in favour of a very worthy and valuable old friend of mine,
    Mr. Long Walk?

    I am afraid that this good gentleman is in danger of getting neglected, if
    not forgotten. We live in days of water trips and land trips, excursions by
    sea, road and rail-bicycles and tricycles, tram cars and motor cars .... but
    in my humble opinion, good honest walking exercise for health beats all
    other kinds of locomotion into a cocked hat.

    T. Thatcher, "A plea for a long walk",

    The Publishers Circular

    1902



    The art of conversation is almost a lost one. People talk as they ride
    bicycles–at a rush–without pausing to consider their surroundings ... what
    has been generally understood as cultured society is rapidly deteriorating
    into baseness and voluntary ignorance. The profession of letters is so
    little understood, and so far from being seriously appreciated, that ...
    Newspapers are full, not of thoughtful honestly expressed public opinion on
    the affairs of the nation, but of vapid personalities interesting to none
    save gossips and busy bodies.

    Marie Corelli,

    Free opinions, freely expressed

    1905



    There is a great tendency among the children of today to rebel against
    restraint, not only that placed upon them by the will of the parent. But
    against any restraint or limitation of what they consider their rights ...
    this fact has filled well minded people with great apprehensions for the
    future.

    Rev. Henry Hussmann,

    The authority of parents

    1906



    Our modern family gathering, silent around the fire, each individual with
    his head buried in his favourite magazine, is the somewhat natural outcome
    of the banishment of colloquy from the school ...

    The Journal of Education, Volume 29

    1907



    Plays in theatres at the present time present spectacles and deal openly
    with situations which no person would have dared to mention in general
    society forty years ago... The current representations of nude men and women
    in the daily journals and the illustrated magazines would have excluded such
    periodicals from all respectable families two decades ago... Those who have
    been divorced ... forty and fifty years ago lost at once and irrevocably
    their standing in society, while to-day they continue in all their social
    relationships, hardly changed...

    Editorial, The Watchman, Boston

    1908



    We write millions more letters than did our grandfathers, but the increase
    in volume has brought with it an automatic artificial machine-like ring ...
    an examination of a file of old letters reveals not only a remarkable grasp
    of details. But a fitness and courtliness too often totally lacking in the
    mechanical curt cut and dried letters of to-day.

    Forrest Crissey, Handbook of Modern Business Correspondence

    1908



    A hundred years ago it took so long and cost so much to send a letter that
    it seemed worth while to put some time and thought into writing it. Now the
    quickness and the cheapness of the post seem to justify the feeling that a
    brief letter to-day may be followed by another next week–a "line" now by
    another to-morrow.

    At the top of the panel is an equation showing Bayes' Theorem for the
    probability that a person is near the ocean given that they just picked up a
    seashell.

    The probability that I'm near the ocean given I picked up a seashell equals
    the probability I picked up a seashell given I'm near the ocean times the
    probability I'm near the ocean all divided by the probability I picked up a
    seashell.

    The size of the part of Earth's surface directly under various space objects

    [Several images are shown, of space objects of differing size and at
    different distances from Earth, illustrating the differing sizes of their
    "shadows" as mapped onto Earth's surface viewed from the center of the
    Earth.]

    [The first image merely sets the stage: Earth is a full circle, with two
    figures — Cueball and Megan — standing on it; a small space object casts a
    "shadow" on Megan, while a slightly larger object, though proportionally
    farther away, casts just about the same size shadow next to Cueball.]

    [The second image is a map showing London, with the Thames running through
    it, and a ring highway running around it labeled "London's M25 Orbital
    Freeway". A grey circle is overlaid, just about the diameter of the M25; it
    is labeled "The Sun and The Moon (about the same size)".]

    [The third image has a small grey rectangle in one corner labeled "Soccer
    field" for comparison. The image is dominated by four large, grey circles,
    considerably larger than the soccer field, labeled "Saturn", "Mars",
    "Jupiter", and "Venus", with Mars slightly larger than Saturn, Jupiter
    approximately twice the diameter of Saturn, and Venus approximately three
    times the diameter of Saturn. Smaller circles are labeled "Mercury",
    "Uranus", and "Neptune", with Mercury still somewhat larger than the soccer
    field, Uranus about its size, and Neptune slightly smaller.]

    [The fourth image has the soccer field blown up to take up much of the view;
    its center circle, goal areas, and corner kick areas are visible. Labeled
    grey circles of various circles are again overlain: Callisto and Ganymede
    are about as large as one half of the field; Io, Titan, and Europa are
    somewhat smaller than half the field; and Ceres, Triton, and Pluto are much
    smaller (all three together would probably fit into the soccer field's
    center circle).]

    [In the fifth image, there is a different grey rectangle, this one labeled
    "Ping Pong table", with a few balls and paddles visible. An irregular ovoid
    labeled "Phobos" is about the size of the table, as is a circle labeled "R.
    Doradus". An irregular circular shape labeled "Deimos" is about the size of
    half the table; a circle labeled "Betelgeuse" is a little smaller, and a
    circle labeled "Eris" is a little smaller, though still comfortably filling
    most of half of the table.]

    [In the sixth image, a light grey image of laptop computer keyboard and
    screen is shown, viewed from directly above. An irregular shape labeled
    "4942 Munroe" is slightly larger than the laptop, while circles labeled
    "Alpha Centauri A", "Sirius", and "Alpha Centauri B" form a descending
    series somewhat smaller than it. Circles labeled "Proxima Centauri" and
    "Barnard's Star" are considerably smaller than the laptop: Proxima Centauri
    would fit on the trackpad, while Barnard's Star covers perhaps four keys on
    the keyboard.]

    [In the seventh image we see a greatly zoomed-in shape which is identified
    as the "Tilde on laptop keyboard". A circle labeled "HD 189733 b
    (permadeath)" is almost as large as the tilde is wide; a circle labeled "Tau
    Ceti C (giant dog planet)" is somewhat smaller. Circles labeled "Gleise 581
    g (jelly-filled planet)", "Gleise 667 C c (PILF)", and "HD 20794 c
    (moonchild)" are all 1/2 to 1/3 as wide as the tilde is wide. A smaller
    circle labeled "Event horizon of the black hole at the center of our galaxy"
    fits comfortably within the tilde's stroke width. A very small dot off in
    one corner (much smaller than the tilde or anything else in the image) is
    labeled "KOI-1686.01 (emergency backup earth)".]

    [Finally, in the eighth image, the size comparison is to the grey outlines
    of four bacilliform bacteria labeled "E. coli". The outlines of two
    interstellar probes are shown, with circular main housings and protruding
    instruments and antennae. They are labeled "Voyager 1" and "Voyager 2".]

    of the next century, it is not impossible, but that future antiquaries may
    occupy page after page in discussing so interesting a matter. We think it
    right, therefore, to put it on record in the Oriental Herald that the
    'Shakesperian Rope Bridges' are of much less classic origin; that Mr Colin
    Shakespear, who, besides his dignity as Postmaster, now signs himself

    Notes from the past

    It's desirable every thing printed should be preserved, for we cannot now
    tell how useful it may become two centuries hence.

    Christopher Baldwin

    1834



    I predict that a century hence the Canadian people will be the noblest
    specimens of humanity on the face of the earth

    Rev. John Bredin

    1863



    In the twenty-first century mankind will subsist entirely upon jellies.

    The Booklover

    1903



    The twenty-first century baby is destined to be rocked and cradled by
    electricity, warmed and coddled by electricity, perhaps fathered and
    mothered by electricity. Probably the only thing he will be left to do
    unaided will be to make love.

    Mrs. John Lane, The fortnightly

    1905



    To-day, in the city of New York, sixty-six different tongues are spoken. A
    century hence, there will probably be only one.

    The American Historical Magazine

    1907



    I often think what interesting history we are making for the student of the
    twenty-first century.

    Willian Carey Jones

    1908



    China may be a great shoe market a decade or a century from now.

    Boot and Shoe Recorder

    1914



    We cannot settle the problem, and I venture the prophecy that perhaps a
    century from now this same question may be brought before some future
    society and discussed very much as it is tonight.

    Dr. Barton C. Hirst on the subject of abortion

    1914



    By the twenty-first century I believe we shall all be telepaths.

    Gumbriel, character in Antic Hay

    1923



    The physician of the twenty-first century… may even criticize the language
    of the times, and may find that some of our words have become as offensive
    to him as the term "lunatic" has become offensive to us.

    Dr. C. Macfie Campbell

    1924



    Historians of the twenty-first century will look back with well-placed scorn
    on the shallow-minded days of the early twentieth century when football
    games and petting parties were considered the most important elements of a
    college education.

    Mary Eileen Ahern, Library Bureau

    1926



    In the year A.D. 2014 journalists will be writing on the centenary of the
    great war — that is, if there has not been a greater war.

    Cueball: My console went dead!

    Hairbun: Mine too!

    Megan: What's happening?!

    [Another zoom in on Cueball's head and torso and glowing screen. He has both
    hands down.]

    Cueball: There's a new signal going out over the transmitter!

    Megan (off panel): A bug?

    Cueball: Someone else is in the system!

    [Zoom in on Hairbun's head and torso. She is also working on her laptop,
    with the glowing screen visible.]

    Hairbun: Kill the connection!

    Cueball (off panel): I can't find it!

    Hairbun: They're firing the probe's engines!

    Cueball (off panel): No!!

    [Back to a zoom in on Cueball. He points at his screen.]

    Megan (off panel): Who's doing this?? Stop them!

    Hairbun (off panel): I'm trying!

    Cueball: Look! My screen!

    [Same setting as when Megan and Ponytail entered the control-room, but
    Ponytail has a hand to her mouth and she and Megan stand close to Cueball
    who has taken his hands off the keyboard. The text on Cueball's laptop
    screen is shown above the setting, indicated with zigzag lines:]

    [The last four panels is outside night scenes with a black sky above. In the
    first of these a woman (Burn) with long hair (Megan like) and a hairy man
    (Crash) is seen in a swimming pool with blue water.]

    [A zoom out reveals that the pool is on top of a skyscraper in a vertically
    developed, downtown setting with lots of light in all the skyscrapers, one
    of which is even taller than the one with the pool. From the top of the
    central skyscraper speech lines come which indicate that the two from the
    pool is up there speaking, and we get their names from this panel.]

    Burn: Crash?

    Crash: Yeah, Burn?

    [Same setting but only one speech line.]

    Burn: Make a wish.

    [The last panel shows the same setting, but with the spacecraft streaking
    across the sky as it enters the Earths atmosphere and burns up in a way that
    is indistinguishable from a meteoroid.]

    [Caption at the top of this chart:]

    Earth's Land Mammals by Weight

    [Below the caption is a light gray block with a label (in light gray as
    well) to indicating the value of each block:] 

    = 1,000,000 tons

    [Below this there is a row with three blocks each in a different color, dark
    and light gray and green, each block is labeled to the right:] 

    Humans

    Our pets and livestock

    Wild animals

    [The rest of the comic consist of a chart with different groups made up of
    these individually and differently colored blocks, each grouping
    representing the weight of a different mammals, except the center part, the
    only one with dark gray block, which represent humans. The largest group to
    the left is the only one larger than the humans group in the center. There
    are 22 groups in total, 1 human group with 358 dark gray block, 13 groups of
    light gray with a total of 864 blocks and 8 green groups with a total of 34
    blocks for a total of 256 blocks. Both the light gray and the green groups
    are spread out on all sides of the human center group. Only difference is
    that all the green are on the very outside, whereas some of the smaller
    light gray groups are close to the core, far from the outside. The five
    largest groups of light gray blocks are labeled, as well as the smallest
    group consisting only of a single green block. All the labels has a line
    pointing to the relevant group and all of them are on the outside of the
    entire block. Going clockwise from the top left the labels are:]

    Cattle

    Pigs

    Goats

    Sheep

    Horses

    Elephants

    [At the bottom right of the comic is the following gray text with a
    reference:]

    [This transcript only transcribes what can be seen in the picture shown at
    the top of the explanation here.]

    [The comic starts with two panels. In the top panel we see Knit Cap Girl
    sitting at a desk in front of her laptop typing. There is a speech line up
    to a gray but empty speech bubble.]

    [The second panel below has the same gray background as the empty speech
    bubble above. Here is presented four options to what Knit Cap Girl could be
    saying. They are marked a, b, c and d written in small white rectangles next
    to the text. There is a small arrow at the top pointing to the first panel:]

    a Hurry! We're in talks with Facebook.

    b These stupid tiles... I'll just play one more game.

    c Refresh... No new email... Refresh... No new tweets... Refresh...

    d Oh. Hey. There's some kind of political thing going on. 

    [Once the reader chooses one of the options the text will appear in the
    speech bubble where the gray area is replaced with the usual white
    background. The lower gray panel disappears. Now the comic really begins.]

    [A new panel is shown after the selection, again with one to four options to
    choose from in the new gray panel below. This will continue until it comes
    to an end where the reader finally only has the choice to suggest the next
    line.]

    [The order of the up to four options are random, and changes every time you
    begin again (or even go back to a previous frame). This means that the a-d
    in the transcript is not the same next time. In some few panels there are
    even more than four options. To see the fifth you have to reload, then you
    may find this fifth option next time. The first panel is one of those with
    five options.] 

    [The fifth not shown above is: Let's see if BSD is any easier to install
    nowadays., see image with this option in the trivia section.]

    [In the first days of the comic when it developed quickly, new options
    appeared only to later disappear. Gravity. Lots of it. is one of those lost
    options from the first panel. At one time there was also by mistake two
    versions of one of the other five mentioned above. But this was later
    deleted. Below in the trivia section there are permalinks to all the
    different starting options, including the now lost gravity story.]

    right from the last small panel, having just reach the upper part of the
    curve and has thus turned left to face them, before the swing will go down
    left again. The background is completely white with no indications of the
    trees and pools from the first panel.]

    diode lights showing. During all six panels the server stays the same. Meg
    is standing with her arms down in four panels. It will be noted when she
    does not. Meg talks to the server. The server "thinks" all the time, i.e. we
    see its memory in all panels. The top and bottom line is breaking the edge
    of the thought bubble making it difficult to discern. In every second panel
    it replies to Meg. In these panels the number of letters requested by Meg is
    highlighted with yellow color.]

    Meg: Server, are you still there? If so, reply "POTATO" (6 letters).

    [There is a graph with the x-axis labeled as 'time' increasing to the right.
    The y-axis is unlabeled but it can be assumed that it could be labeled
    'understanding'.]

    The line stays flat until the first bump, which is annotated "Took High
    School Physics".

    The line decreases, then grows to a higher maximum with the annotation "Got
    Physics Degree".

    There is a small amount of decrease until a gradual bump in the graph

    The good news is that according to the latest IPCC report, if we enact

    Without prompt, aggressive limits on CO2 emissions, the Earth will likely
    warm by an average of 4°-5°C by the century's end.

    HOW BIG A CHANGE IS THAT?

    [A ruler chart is drawn inside a frame.]

    In the coldest part of the last ice age, Earth's average temperature was
    4.5°C below the 20th century norm.

    Let's call a 4.5°C difference one "Ice Age Unit."

    [A graph with the x-axis showing time in years from 1940 to some time after
    2010 (presumably ca. 2014). The y-axis shows percentage of population. The
    graph has 4 lines, 2 solid and 2 dashed, with 2 different colors: red and
    blue. The red lines indicate statistics concerning interracial marriage,
    while the blue indicate statistics concerning same-sex marriage. The solid
    lines indicate population living in states where that type of marriage is
    legal, while the dashed lines indicate popular approval of that type of
    marriage based on various polls.]

    [Solid red line:] Percentage of US population living in states with legal
    interracial marriage

    [Dot on solid red line:] Full legal access: 1967

    [Dashed red line:] Popular approval of interracial marriage (Source: Gallup
    Polls)

    [Dot on dashed red line:] Majority approval: 1995

    [Dashed blue line:] Popular approval of same-sex marriage (Source: various
    polls)

    [Dot on dashed blue line:] Majority approval: 2011

    [Solid blue line:] Percentage of US population living in states with legal
    same-sex marriage

    [Interracial marriage is indicated as being more than 50% legal in 1940,
    with a very slight downward trend that spikes up slightly ca. 1948, then
    trends slowly upward to about 65% until ca. 1967, at which point it spikes
    directly to 100% legality and remains there through 2014. Popular approval
    of interracial marriage is below 10% in the late 1950s, rising steadily to
    approximately 40% in 1980, then continuing to rise more slowly to the
    majority approval point in 1995, and spiking up to about 65% ca. 1997,
    plateauing until ca. 2003, rising quickly again to about 75% ca. 2006 and
    rising generally upward to the final ca. 2014 statistic depicted between 85%
    and 90% popular approval. The visual effect seems to be a wide gap of time
    between legalization of and popular approval of interracial marriage.
    Popular approval appears to trail legalization by no less than 20 years at
    any given point.

    Popular approval of same-sex marriage (according to "various polls") is
    depicted first at about 15% ca. 1986, trending gradually upward until ca.
    2000, where it plateaus between 35% and 40% to resume an upward trend ca.
    2007, continuing steadily through majority approval in 2011 to a ca. 2014
    value between 55% and 60%. The legality of same-sex marriage is indicated to
    start at 0% ca. 2002, then jumps quickly to plateau around 5% until ca.
    2008, at which point it spikes up to between 15% and 20%, then plummets to
    just above than 5% by ca. 2009, jumping quickly back up to between 15% and
    20% between ca. 2010 and 2011, then trending upward even more quickly to end
    at about 55% legality ca. 2014. The visual effect seems to be a more
    turbulent line for legality of same-sex marriage than any of the other
    trends, which also seems to be quickly closing on the popular approval
    trend. Popular approval has preceded legalization by nearly 20 years at
    certain points, but the trends appear to be closing and may intersect by
    2015 or 2016.]

    rankasti. Kuljin metsän halki. Kuulin linnun laulavan. Yksinäinen, mutta
    itsenäinen ja vahva, tulkitseva ääni. Kaunis. Minne linnut menevät sateella?
    En ole koskaan nähnyt lintuja rankkasateessa. Luulen, että ne yrittävät
    löytää suojan. Kuusien ja mäntyjen oksistossa on varmaan suojaisaa.
    Kallioiden koloihin ja pieniin luolastoihin voi ehkä lintukin hiipiä.
    Rohkeille löytyy pihoilta suojapaikkoja. Ehkä linnulla oli oma pesäkolo.
    Siellä oli lämmintä ja kuivaa. Sieltä saattoi rauhassa katsella sateen
    vierailua metsässä. Siellä saattoi jopa iloita sateesta ja laulaa.

    the other frames.]

    Black Hat: What's in there?

    Cueball: The AI-Box Experiment.

    Box: AI

    [Cueball is continuing to talk off-panel. This is written above a close-up
    with part of the laptop and the box, which can now be seen to be labeled:]

    Cueball (off-panel): A superintelligent AI can convince anyone of anything,
    so if it can talk to us, there's no way we could keep it contained.

    Box:

    Superintelligent 

    AI


    Do not open


    [Cueball turns the other way towards the box as Black Hat walks past him and
    reaches for the box.]

    Cueball: It can always convince us to let it out of the box.

    Black Hat: Cool. Let's open it.

    Box: AI

    [Cueball takes one hand to his mouth while lifting the other towards Black
    Hat who has already picked up the box (disconnecting it from the laptop) and
    holds it in one hand with the top slightly downwards. He takes of the lid
    with his other hand and by shaking the box (as indicated with three times
    two lines above and below his hands, the lid and the bottom of the box) he
    managed to get the AI to float out of the box. It takes the form of a small
    black star that glows. The star, looking much like an asterisk "*" is
    surrounded by six outwardly-curved segments, and around these are two thin
    and punctures circle lines indicating radiation from the star. A punctured
    line indicated how the AI moved out of the box and in between Cueball and
    Black Hat, to float directly above the laptop on the floor.]

    Cueball: -No, wait!!

    Box: AI

    [The AI floats higher up above the laptop between Cueball and Black Hat who
    looks up at it. Black Hat holds the now closed box with both hands. The AI
    speaks to them, forming a speak bubble starting with a thin black curved
    arrow line up to the section where the text is written in white on a black
    background that looks like a starry night. The AI speaks in only lower case
    letters, as opposed to the small caps used normally.]

    AI: hey. i liked that box. put me back.

    Black Hat: No.

    Box: AI

    [The AI star suddenly emits a very bright light fanning out from the center
    in six directions along each of the six curved segments, and the entire
    frame now looks like a typical drawing of stars as seen through a telescope,
    but with these six whiter segments in the otherwise dark image. Cueball
    covers his face and Black Hat lifts up the box taking the lid off again. The
    orb again speaks in white but very large (and square like) capital letters.
    Black Hats answer is written in black, but can still be seen due to the
    emitted light from the AI, even with the black background.]

    AI: LET ME BACK INTO THE BOX

    Black Hat: Aaa! OK!!!

    Box: AI

    [All the darkness and light disappears as the AI flies into the box again
    the same way it flew out with a punctuated line going from the center of the
    frame into the small opening between the lid and the box as Black Hat holds
    the box lower. Cueball is just watching. There is a sound effect as the orb
    renters the box:]

    standing next to the laptop, although disconnected.]

    If you encounter a hex bolt, but you only brought screwdrivers, you can try
    sandwiching the head of the bolt between two parallel screwdriver shafts,
    squeezing the screwdrivers together with a hand at either end, then
    twisting. It doesn't work and it's a great way to hurt yourself, but you can
    try it!

    [Commentary above the speeches.]

    In 1969, Nixon staffer William Safire wrote a speech for the president to
    deliver if the Apollo 11 return launch failed, stranding the doomed
    astronauts on the Moon.

    Uncovered in 1999, it is often called the greatest speech never given.

    Today, the full set of Safire's contingency speeches has been found.

    In event astronauts stranded on Moon

    Fate has ordained that the men who went to the Moon to explore in peace will
    stay on the Moon to rest in peace.

    [Here, several lines from the original speech are cut.]

    In ancient days, men looked at stars and saw their heroes in the
    constellations. In modern times, we do much the same, but our heroes are
    epic men of flesh and blood.

    Others will follow, and surely find their way home. Man’s search will not be
    denied. But these men were the first, and they will remain the foremost in
    our hearts. For every human being who looks up at the Moon in the nights to
    come will know that there is some corner of another world that is forever

    In event spacecraft goes missing

    Neil Armstrong, Edwin Aldrin, and Michael Collins went to the Moon as
    ambassadors of peace for all mankind, and all mankind prays that they may
    yet return safely home.

    We are separated from the Moon by a vast gulf of space, against which their
    tiny vessel appeared as but a drifting speck. For a few brief seconds, we
    took our eye off them, and despite days of desperate searching, never again
    was their vessel sighted from Earth.

    While these men are lost, they are not forgotten, and their sacrifice will
    not

    In even astronauts abscond with spacecraft

    We do not know what led Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins to betray the trust we
    placed in them, abandon their mission, and steer their vessel toward Mars.
    Nor do we know what compelled them to transmit such hurtful messages back to
    Earth, heaping contempt on their onetime home.

    But whatever the cause of their dereliction, I call upon the United States
    to commit itself, before this year is out, to launching a mission to chase
    down Apollo 11 and return its crew to earth to face justice. We must not
    rest until

    In event spacecraft returns with extra astronauts

    While there is much we do not understand, tonight all of earth is united in
    celebrating the safe return of our brave explorers.

    We of course have many questions, and in the days and weeks to come we will
    demand answers. How many souls were truly aboard Apollo 11 when it launched?
    Who are the six men now in quarantine aboard the USS Hornet? What happened

    In event spacecraft hits U.S.S. Hornet, crushing Nixon

    President Agnew: Tonight, we have experienced a great national triumph and a
    great national loss. We take joy in the safe return from the Moon of Neil
    Armstrong, Edwin Aldrin, and Michael Collins, but that joy is tempered with
    sorrow as we mourn our president’s tragic death beneath their wayward
    capsule.

    Richard Nixon wholeheartedly supported our courageous astronauts as they
    carried the hopes and prayers of Earth to the heavens, and in the moment of
    their homecoming, he himself has departed on that ultimate voyage. As we
    grieve, we must rededicate ourselves to the cause for which our president

    [A two-column table illustrating this. The headings are actually standing
    above the table.]


     If they say...

     It means...


     "It doesn't do anything new"

    a gigantic success.



     "Why would anyone want that?"


     "Really exciting"

     The product will be a flop.
    Years later, its ideas will

    show up in something successful.




    "I've already preorded one"

    comic. He shifts position from sitting, leaning back on one hand, laying
    down on his belly to finally sitting more upright. Above these four panels
    and breaking the frame of the outer panels of the comic we see what he reads
    during these four panels:]

    I told her we were going to get married, and all she could talk about was
    frogs.

    She said there's these hills where it's hot and rains all the time, and in
    the rainforests there are these very tall trees and right in the top
    branches

    of the trees there are these like great big flowers called... bromeliads, I
    think, and water gets into the flowers and makes little pools and there's a

    type of frog that lays eggs in the pools and tadpoles hatch, and grow into
    new frogs and these little frogs live their whole lives in the flowers right

    at the top of the trees and don't even know about the ground, and once you
    know the world is full of things like that, your life is never the same.

    — Masklin, Terry Prattchet's The Bromeliad Trilogy


























    [Below are four more panels. Cueball stops reading in the book. Leaves the
    book and begins to walk. Walks out on a leaf from a big flower. Finally,

    Furthermore his legs are shackled. There are pools of water on the floor.]

    its label changes from diagram to diagram.]

    [The red section of the first diagram mainly overlaps the innermost section,
    but about a third of it is in the second section. The labels are written
    above the three white sections and then inside the red section. The labels

    less implies you care at least some amount.

    Megan: Every choice of phrasing and spelling and tone and timing carries
    countless signals and contexts and subtexts and more, 

    Megan: and every listener interprets those signals in their own way. 

    Megan: Language isn't a formal system. Language is glorious chaos.

    [Zoom in on Megan's head.]

    Megan: You can never know for sure what any words will mean to anyone. 

    Megan: All you can do is try to get better at guessing how your words affect
    people, so you can have a chance of finding the ones that will make them
    feel something like what you want them to feel. 

    Megan: Everything else is pointless.

    [They have stopped walking as Megan holding a hand out has turned around
    facing Ponytail.]

    Megan: I assume you're giving me tips on how you interpret words because you
    want me to feel less alone. 

    Megan: If so, then thank you. 

    Megan: That means a lot.

    [Megan and Ponytail resume with their walking.]

    Megan: But if you're just running my sentences past some mental checklist so
    you can show off how well you know it,

    "ghost" versions of you along different routes, simulating their travel
    using the real-time data

    [Cueball, again talking to White Hat, holding the smartphone down.]

    Cueball: That way, you can see which route turned out to be faster in

    [A graph is shown with two curves. The Y-axis indicated how you feel, with
    three levels indicated with small ticks on the inside of the axis. These are
    labeled to the left of the Y–axis. The X-axis gives the time. The unit is
    given (days written in gray text) to the left and then the number of days
    are noted below the axis for each of the eight ticks on the inside of the
    axis. Both curves begin at the lowest level just off the Y-axis. One curve,
    indicating how bad you feel, rises rapidly, reaching its maximum in less
    than two days only to fall off almost as rapidly, ending up on an even lower
    level than it began with before day 5. The other curve, indicating how bad
    you sound, start out by staying constantly low, first rising on day 3, when
    the first curve are drooping down. They cross between day 3 and 4, and first
    then does the second curve rise, reaching its max around day 5, not as high
    a maximum  as the first curve, but it stays up longer, falling only
    moderately off even after day 8, where it reaches the middle level on the
    Y-axis. Above the two curves are two line intervals that indicated when you
    need sympathy and when you get it. This text is written on the broken line.
    All this is in gray text. Below the X-axis are the symptoms listed for the
    different time period. These are written in white inside gray rectangles.
    The rectangles are a different length depending on how many days they last.

    structures. It has two legs and two arms, a torso and a head. It clearly
    shoots something out of it’s right “hand”. This shot seems to create an
    explosion a third of the way towards the left robot. There are two mushroom
    clouds from explosions behind both robots (left and right). Between them
    there are one more explosion up in the air close to the left robot, and what

    it. They are drawn in a panel that is only half the width of the next panel
    below]

    Ponytail: Over here we have the universe control panel.

    Ponytail: These dials, for example, control Christmas.

    [A dial is shown. There is a label at the top and then there are ten
    settings, five symmetrically on the left and right side, but no setting
    straight up or down. It looks allot like the dial on a washing machine with
    different programs. The dial points towards the top left setting. All
    settings are labeled and there is a small line going to the point on the
    dial connected with each setting. The line at 3 and 9 o'clock are straight
    the other 8 are divided in two, where the first part goes horizontally and
    then bends either up or down, to end in the right position. Here the labele
    at the top and then the setting labels clockwise from top right, thus ending
    with the one the dial is set to:]

    turns the dial. Ponytail has taken her hands to her mouth.]

    Dial: Click Click

    A Christmas gift for physicists:

    The Fixion

    A new particle that explains everything

    [A chart resembling a Feynman diagram is shown. It begins with a solid line
    coming down at the top, going a little to the left. The line continues
    downwards all the time, but changes direction 16 times before exiting at the
    bottom almost straight under the starting point. At every point where it
    changes direction, there is some kind of “interaction” with something
    outside this line. There are 19 phrases, 10 on the left and 9 on the right.
    11 of these are distinct labels for points on the line as 14 gray curved
    arrows points between these 11 phrases to specific points on the line. Three
    of the phrases on the left has two arrows pointing to two different, but
    close, parts of the line. The main central line is solid all the way, except
    at the very bottom, where it “disappears” inside a hole only to “reappear”
    later from a similar hole. Between these two holes the line is dotted. The
    lines going away (or to) the main line can be straight and solid, straight
    and dotted, wavy lines (with different waviness), even looking like a
    spiral. Two straight solid lines ends up at two space probes, and finally
    the last two straight solid lines coming in (and out) on either side of the
    “hole” in the line has arrow pointing in and out. Below the phrases will be
    listed in reading order, taking one on each side alternatingly. Above each
    is described if there are any arrow and, if there are, what they points at.]

    [Left: Arrow pointing to the very first part of the main line:]

    Main component of dark matter


    [Right: Arrow pointing to the very first part of the main line, but below
    the previous arrow:]

    Confines quarks and gluons


    [Left: Arrow points to the first solid line going left and upwards:]

    Neutralizes monopoles


    [Right: No arrow:]

    Suppresses antimatter in early universe


    [Left: Two arrows points to two dotted lines going out left and downwards
    below the first solid line:]

    Spontaneously emits dark energy


    [Right: Arrow pointing to several lines going almost parallel with the main
    line. The first line closest to the arrow is not connected with the main
    line. It bends closer to the other lines in the middle. The next line is
    connected to the main line, and is thus actually two lines going in to the
    main line. The same goes for the inner line, where there is some distance
    between the entry and exit, as the middle of these three lines connect to
    the main line in between. In principle there are four lines going in/out and
    one not connected, but it looks like three lines:]

    Mediates proton decay but then hides it


    [Left: One arrow points to the first wavy line (7 peaks) coming out and up
    towards the dotted lines above. A second arrow points further down the main
    line where there are three more wavy lines coming out, but to the right,
    they are all of the same length and go almost straight right, only a little
    down. The first has as short a wave length as the line above to the left,
    but as it is shorter it only has 6 peaks. Then the wavelength decreases to a
    very long one for the last, 5 peaks and then 3 peaks. The arrow points
    almost where the middle wavy line exits the main line:]

    Introduces dispersion in perytons from kitchen microwaves, explaining fast
    radio bursts


    [Right: An arrow point to the part of the main line between the three
    parallel lines and the first wavy line:]

    Broken symmetry causes ϴ=0, explaining unobserved neutron dipole moment


    [Left: No arrow:]

    Causes alpha effect


    [Right: No arrow, but right next to the middle of the three wavy line:]

    Covers naked singularities


    [Left: An arrow points to a spiraling line going upwards to the left:]

    Intercepts certain gravitational waves before they're observed.


    [Right: No arrow, but right next to the bottom of the three wavy line:]

    Causes coronal heating


    [Left: No arrow:]

    Higgs-ish


    [Right: A long arrow point to the point of the main line just below the line
    pointing to the bottom (and left) of the space probes:]

    Superluminally smooths anisotropies in early universe (but adds faint
    polarization for BICEP3 to find)


    [Left: One arrows point towards the point on the main lines where a solid
    line goes to the right and up and another arrow points on another solid line
    going away from the main line towards left and down. At the end of both
    lines are drawn spacecrafts with satellite dish and solar panels:]

    Accelerates certain spacecraft during flybys


    [Right: No arrow, but right next to the solid line with an arrow going into
    the main line just before the first hole where the main line disappears and
    becomes dotted:]

    Triggers Siberian sinkholes


    [Left: No arrow:]

    Melts ice in "Snowball Earth" scenario


    [Right: Arrow points to the dotted part of the main line between the two
    holes:]

    Transports neutrinos faster than light, but only on certain days through one
    area of France


    [Left: No arrow but the last solid line, with an arrow pointing left, that
    is going away from the main line, point almost directly at it:]

    objects diameter on the y-axis and the distance from “me” (Randall) on the
    X-axis. Both axes are labeled and have several ticks most of which also have
    labels. A region to the right, with possible new planets including Planet 9
    with a “?”, is shaded light red, and a small rectangle at the top left with
    the same color tells what this color means. The region, of undiscovered
    dwarf planets, is shaded pink, also to indicate that here may be more of
    these, but the lighter color indicate that these will not be new “planets”.
    The eight known planets are marked with a black dot, and also this is
    explained with a dot under the colored rectangle. The Moon is indicated with
    a similar dot, but in gray, and the name is in brackets. The chart itself is
    divided into several labeled regions, the smallest with the label outside
    and an arrow pointing in. In one case a label breaks a border, and in two
    regions there are more labels, although these clearly belong to different
    regions within these regions, with different sizes and/or distances.]

    pipe

    Assuming they all flowed at the same speed of about 4m/s

    Note: Many pipelines would overlap (eg. soda/corn syrup)

    [There is a small panel to the right showing three gray pipes of different
    sizes leading out over a large hole in the ground. Only a part of the hole
    can be seen at the bottom left part of the panel, but it curves around
    indicating it is a large circular hole. The pipes are supported by small
    legs beneath them and from the end of all three thick liquids are squirting
    out and down into the hole. The first pipe is by far the largest; the liquid
    from it is white, but not as white as the background. The second pipe is by
    far the smallest squirting dark red liquid and the final rightmost pipe is
    in between and squirts our light brown liquid. Each pipe is labeled. The
    label on the smallest cannot be read properly, but from the info gained in
    the next panel it can be inferred for certain what it says (and this is
    indicated here below):]

    labels are indicated by color and size, going roughly from top left in

    [The panel just described is indicated to fit into a small rectangle at the
    top left of the next panel below. There are four lines ending at the four
    corners of this small rectangle, two of these are going to the two bottom
    corners and the other two ends on the lower part of the panel just above the
    small rectangle. They are indicated to go under the panel and would hit the
    two top corners if extrapolated. The 11 largest circles are clearly seen,
    but most of the other circles can also be noted. The colors are the same but
    any features in the original circles as well as the labels are gone. The
    part of the black top frame of the next panel below is faded out to gray in
    between the section cut off by the two lines going to the bottom corners of
    the panel above. This rectangle indicated the increasing size compared to
    the first panel above.]

    [Apart from the insert mentioned above the second panel follows the same
    layout, but with 22 circles with even larger range of sizes. The panel is
    more than twice as long as the first panel. Blondie is drawn at the top of
    the panel just left of the middle. Her hair close to the top, just below the
    line going to the right corner above. There are two medium and five smaller
    circles to her left and one small close to her head and one huge circle to
    her right. Her feet are less than a third down this panel standing on top of
    the next row of circles. In the bottom half of the panel there is a giant
    circle which almost touches the left side of the panel. There are smaller
    circles above it and down along the right side. One last circle is to the
    left almost at the bottom. At the very bottom is a slightly curving line to
    indicate a much much larger blue circle that only graces the panel (no. 23).
    There is a small green fish in this water to the left of the label. Below
    the labels are again listed as above. One label has a foot note. But it is
    written directly beneath the circle in which it is referenced. So it will be
    written together with the label on the next line. There is also one case
    with an arrow used to indicate where the label belongs.]

    [Cueball is standing in front of a family consisting a Cueball-like guy
    holding a newborn baby, with spiky hair, in a blanket and Megan. Cueball is
    thinking lots of thoughts about what to say to the couple upon seeing their
    baby for the first time. There is thus a huge thinking bubble in the top of
    the panel above the characters. Everything in this bubble has been crossed
    out like taking a pencil and drawing lines on top of the text, but it can
    still be read. After using all this time thinking, Cueball finally decides
    what to say, only to immediately regret this as can be seen in a small
    thought bubble below his spoken line, which is between the huge and the
    small bubble.]

    Cueball (thoughts that are crossed out): 

    Wow, it's getting so big! Unlike most babies, which stay the same size
    forever.

    Hi! I'm talking to a baby!

    What brand is it?

    Wow, definitely much smaller than a regular person!

    You sure did make that.

    ★★★★☆ Great baby.

    It doesn't really look like you since you're not a baby.

    So do they learn words one at a time alphabetically or can you pick the
    order or what?

    I hope it does a good job.


    Cueball: Wow, that's a really cool baby!

    Cueball (thinking): Dammit.

    [A white map with an outline that closely resembles that of the mainland of
    the United States of America with gray all around the black border. But on
    closer inspection most of the states do not look right. The 48 mainland
    states are all there, however, with their name or abbreviations written on
    them as a label in gray text. But they have all been shuffled around and
    then reassembled as a jigsaw puzzle in the same shape as USA. The name
    labels for most of the states have been rotated, often to follow the new
    rotation of the state in the map. So some are written upside down or have
    been rotated 90 degrees clockwise or counter clockwise or even somewhere in
    between. One state, Michigan, has even been split up in two so there are 49
    instead of 48 labels. For the states that have been named only with state
    abbreviations the full name is written in brackets behind the transcript of
    the abbreviation. Here below all the states are listed approximately in
    columns going from the top left and down and then moving right to the next

    [After a loading image with a rotating tree in the middle and the text
    "Loading..." with the three dots appearing one at a time, and then disappear
    when all three have been there the image shown above in the explanation will
    appear:]

    [Description of the image above: A piece of bare landscape is shown. At the
    edges there are some rocks or stones raising the level from the general
    level through the center of the panel. Above the middle, a little more than
    halfway to the to of the panel, is a light bulb sitting inside a lamp that
    reminds of the desk lamp from the movie Luxo Jr. The lamp shines a yellow
    light down on the landscape in a broad cone that jus reaches the first rock
    to the left, but not those to the right. The lamp just hovers in the air. In
    the top right corner are two gray icons. The top one has a black frame and
    shows an image of a lamp, tilted left as opposed to the straight position of
    the lamp in the image. There is a + sign below in the left corner. The
    second icon without a frame has a large white cross in the middle.]

    [This turns out to be a web applet and using the "+ lamp" icon two more
    lamps can be added getting up to three. They are all adjustable both
    regarding position, direction, color of light and beam width. When selecting
    a lamp a red circle appear around it with a small circle on top that can be
    used to control the light color from blue to the left to red to the right.
    In front is a red arrow that can turn the lamp and it can also be used to
    change the beam width by pulling it away from the lamp or pushing it back.
    The lamps can be moved by just clicking on it and moving it. The other icon
    with a X can be used to remove the lamps (and later any object that appear
    in the garden). When any object is selected there is a red circle around it.
    When this is done the gray cross icon becomes red and can the be used to
    delete the selected item. When no item is selected (either because it is
    deleted, or by clicking in a part of the screen with no items), then the
    cross icon turns gray again. When all three lamps are on, then the "+ lamp"
    icon is faded out.]

    [If you wait (or relax, as in the title text), then a plant will grow or
    animals, humans and other items may appear. This could be birds, snakes,
    octopuses or turtles, Megan or Cueball or a birdbath, a monolith or a tall
    gate just as a few examples. Most of the items appear in one go, but at
    least the largest trees grow up with a big stem first and then adds parts
    later with leaves or empty branches. Also one item may appear on top of
    another item and for instance birds may fly in the air.]

    sign:]

    [13 drawings 8 in the top and 5 in the bottom row of different and weird
    "bicycle" designs. Above them there is a heading, and below each bike a year
    is given. On the very last cycle there is a drinking bottle with a label.]

    Timeline of Bicycle Design

    [Ponytail hanging on to a bending rod that goes down to a single normal
    sized bike wheel. It looks like a unicycle with no seat. The rod is bending
    quite a lot so she looks like she is about to use the contraption as a pole
    vault]

    1810

    [Cueball is running after a device holding on to a rod bend in several
    places before reaching the ground at a very small wheel that then is
    connected with a shorter rod to a normal sized bike wheel.]

    1825 

    [Two normal sized bike wheels connected with a single rod between them.]

    1840 

    [Megan sits on a large saddle on top of a double sized bike wheel, she has
    some kind of handle bars to hold on to (or it could just be the saddle) and
    then a small rod goes down to a half size front wheel.]

    1860 

    [A regular drawing of a Penny-farthing with very small back wheel (half the
    size of the front wheel on the 1860 bike) and very large front wheel (larger
    than the 1860 bike) and pedals in the middle of the front wheel. There are
    no visible handlebars.]

    1875

    [A huge wheel twice the size of the one on the Penny-farthing, and then a
    small wheel (like the small one on the Penny-farthing) hangs in a rod from
    the center of the giant wheel. The small wheel has a saddle attached, but it
    is not straight up.]

    1880 

    [This is the largest bike. Not the largest drawings, but where the other
    have the characters in roughly the same size, this one has a small drawing
    of Cueball standing on top of the wheel holding on to some kind of handle
    bar. The wheel is about three times his height.]

    1900 

    [Cueball sits in the "saddle" of a bike design that is similar to the
    Penny-farthing, but the saddle is more a rod, and the back wheel is on a rod
    going straight down from where the saddle ends. Also there are no pedals, so
    Cueball seems to be directly spinning the front wheel by hand.]

    1915

    [A symmetrical saddle sits on top of single bike wheel, as with a unicycle
    but with no pedals. There are (at least) six progressively smaller wheels
    in-line to the first, three to front and three to the rear, each new wheel
    approximately half the size of the one before. A possible fourth wheel,
    presumed to complete the set of medial stabilisers, can no longer be
    discerned from the rod that goes through the center of the larger wheels.]

    1925

    [Megan stands on top of a saddle that has four individual rods extending
    from it, each to a small wheel. One wheel is directly beneath her, one is
    behind her, one is the same distance in front, and one is farther out in
    front. Megan is pushing the bike with a long flexible rod resembling a pole
    vault.]

    1940 

    [Cueball is running down a steep hill with his arms up, being chased by
    three normal-sized bike wheels.]

    1955

    [Megan sits on a bike contraption that seems to have a holder around her mid
    section rather than her sitting on a saddle. This holder goes to the back
    wheel below her, and there is actually a sprocket with a chain, although no
    clear pedals beneath her feet. She holds on to a very long handle bar, which
    connects with two long rods coming from the sprocket at the front end of the
    bike far ahead of Megan, below which is a wheel, to where the chain is
    actually going. Both wheels seem to be normal size.]

    1980 

    [Another weird contraption of a bike with pedals on both normal sized wheels
    which have handlebars on the side pointing down towards the front. The
    saddle hangs in a swing, connected to a rod above it, which goes to the
    front of the bike and splits in two rods which connect to the center frame
    of the bike. In front of these there is a contraption resembling many styles
    of touring bike handlebars, which sits just above the front wheel. The two
    wheels are connected with a long rod between the center of the wheels and in
    the middle of this is the center part of the frame going up toward the
    handle. On the middle of this is a bottle with a label. Towards the back
    wheel there are two rods sticking out, one presumably a kickstand, the other
    possibly a parking brake.]

    indicates that the smaller one is "greater than" the larger one. Ponytail is
    talking off panel to the left.]

    Ponytail (off panel): Buns have a hierarchy.

    Ponytail (off panel): A bun's rank is determined by its size. Smaller buns
    are higher-ranking.

    [Two normal sized rabbits are sitting left and right of a very small rabbit.
    The smaller rabbit appears to give off a radiant light indicated with gray
    and white alternating rays going through the image. It is indicated that it
    shines on the larger rabbits as they are gray on the side turned away from
    the smaller rabbit and white on the front turned towards it. Ponytail
    narrates above the frame of this half sized panel:]

    Ponytail (narrating): Most buns you see are relatively low-ranking.

    of a king bun.

    [Cueball and a White Hat are walking, Cueball holds both hands in front of
    him palms up.]

    Cueball: The great thing about digital data is that it never degrades.

    [They walk on in the next panel which shows jpeg compression artifacts, as
    if it is a screen shot of the actual image.]

    Cueball: Hard drives fail, of course, but their bits can be copied forever
    without loss.

    [They continue walking in the third panel which is now clearly pixelated,
    the white is slightly discolored, and it contains part of the interface of
    some program, probably supposed to be a screen shot from a smartphone. At
    the bottom there are three blue buttons and one gray. the first is a blue
    "<" indicating back in a browser. Then a grayed out ">" that is not active.
    And then three more standard buttons in blue to the right of those two. The
    interface matches that of an iPhone running Safari in iOS 9 (or other
    versions with the same Safari UI (probably iOS 7-9))]

    Cueball: Film degrades, paint cracks, but a copy of a century-old data file
    is identical to the original.

    [Still walking, now Cueball holds out both arms to the sides, and finally
    White Hat replies. This panel is heavily pixelated and discolored and has a
    distorted aspect ratio. It contains a clear watermark of 9GAG (although
    difficult to read all letters in the end of the first word), even more
    'frame' elements, and text above the image at the bottom (where the last
    letter is obscured by the frame of the image). There is also an internet
    address at the bottom left, but it is not readable except for the
    .tumblr.com ending. In this panel it is clear that it is a screen shot from
    a smart phone. The frame around the image obscure the very top of Cueball's
    text and the half of the last letter in White Hat's reply.]

  transcript: "[A very complicated flow chart, which can only be read in detail using the larger image now shown at the top of this page. This transcript uses the large version, where there is no problem reading all entries.]\n[At the top of the chart there is a large caption, with a smaller caption below:]\nGuide to figuring out the age of an undated world map\n(Assuming it's complete, labeled in english, and detailed enough)\n[Below the starting bracket in the small caption is a start box. It has rounded corners and it is gray with white text. From this box there is a gray line to a box consisting of a black frame with rounded corners. In these kind of boxes there are questions regarding the map in black text. Below this box there are three gray boxes like the start box, superimposed over the bottom frame. In these boxes are the possible answers to the question in the frame above. From each of these options there is a gray line going to similar black framed boxes with other questions either below, or to either side. There can either be two, three or four gray boxes, two the most common. Only at the very bottom of the central branch where it turns out it was a home made map, are there two frames with only one gray question box each. This trend continues over this entire large image. When reaching the end of a branch in the flow chart, there is no line away from one, more or all of the gray boxes for a black frame. When this happens a year range or a guess at what the map shows, or what it is (if it turns out to not be a map) is written below the gray box in gray text. Of the text in the gray boxes are Yes/No, but not always.

    The wicked flee when Gnome Ann pursueth.

    -Proverbs 28:1

    [Gnome Ann takes the groom's place in a wedding, shoving him to the side.
    The groom, Hairy with a bow tie, falls while throwing his arms out. The
    bride stands to the left, in full wedding dress, showing no reaction.]

    What therefore God hath joined together, let Gnome Ann put asunder.

    -Mark 10:9

    jagged edged crater. White smoke rises straight up and then drifts to the
    left forming three separate clouds.]

    Cinder Cone

    [Flat rounded shaped volcano, as a part of a circle. There is not a real
    crater visible but from the center a thin plume of smoke rises up, drift
    drifts to the left and forms a small white cloud.]

    Shield Volcano

    [This is the largest volcano. The tip of this volcano is similar to the
    first volcano, but with more uneven slopes and a bit smaller. The tip is
    clearly separated from the bottom section by a thin jagged line, and below
    the sides of the volcano decreases their slope, so they are less steep than
    the tip. Black smoke rises straight up from the crater and then drifts to
    the left in four thin lines.]

    Stratovolcano

    [A wide volcano spans the entire panel, with a large central crater, with a
    bottom baseline far above the ground level. Just left of the middle of this
    crater is a standard smaller volcano cone, very similar to the shape of the
    tip in the previous panel. Even the smoke from this cones small crater is
    similar to the previous panels.]

    Somma Volcano

    [The central part of this volcano is the same shape as the previous panel.
    This could be a zoom out, revealing that the large crater, is at the center
    on an even larger crater, which again is at the center of a crater that
    spans the panel. A plume of black smoke rises from the centeral cones
    crater, and drifts left as five white clouds.]

    Metasomma Volcano

    [A perfect cone-shape, triangular and steep, with checkered ice cone waffle
    texture, even with a line indicating where the waffle has been a folded. It
    looks like a road up the volcano. Black smoke drift up from the sharp tip,
    no crater, and drifts left forming a small cloud separated from the rest of
    the smoke lines.]

    Waffle Cone

    [Standard cone as in the first, but zoomed in so it fills the panel from
    left to right. The volcano's top has been cut much further down leaving a
    wide crater from which lava is pouring down the sides in large rivers of
    different width and length. To the left one long river has almost reached
    the ground. Cueball is running down the left side, and Megan is running
    after another Cueball with his arms up on the right side. There is a label
    with an arrow pointing to the lava:]

    Label: Baking soda and vinegar

    Science Fair Cone

    [Standard cone like the previous, but with more jagged sloped and crater.
    This volcano erupts with a large explosion with fire and smoke coming out in
    all directions above the crater. A large sound is written above the
    explosion:]

    Sound. Doooooot

    Doot Cone

    [This is not a volcano, but the inverse, a cone down into the ground, the
    ground level no above the center of the panel. The slope down into this cone
    hole is straight, the ground above is more jagged. At the bottom of the hole
    sits a small animal with six legs and an open mouth piece sticking up out of
    the hole. Its fat body is hidden under the ground along with its legs.]

    Antlion

    [Standard volcano cone like the previous volcano. It erupts and the central
    part shows how the erupting material comes up from below ground level (below
    the line at the bottom in which the cone it self stands). The erupting
    material is white rocks on black background. At the top several rocks is
    blown out of the crater top. The sides of the volcano is filled with blobs
    small and large, and stones rolling down the sides. There are two labels,
    each with two arrows. The first labels arrows points to the side of the
    volcano, the second labels arrows points to the erupting material inside and
    outside the volcano:]

    First label: Lava

    Second label: Solid rocks

    Inverse Volcano

    [Standard cone like the doot cone, with a crater that bends down in the
    middle. From this crater eight white ghosts with two black eyes are rising,
    like the smoke, drifting left. The highest ghost is just reaching the edge
    at the top left of the panel. The lowest ghost is still inside the crater
    with its wavy lower parts.]

    Ghost Vent

    [A standard cone like the doot cone. At the top there is lave over the outer
    edges, some of it running down the side. The inside of the volcano has been
    drawn like in the inverse volcano, so it is clear that the magma inside the
    volcano comes up from below ground level (below the line at the bottom in
    which the cone it self stands). There are two labels that contradicts the
    description above. The top label outside the volcano points to the lava with
    an arrow, and the bottom label inside the volcano points to the magma:]

    Top label: Magma

    Bottom label: Lava

    Understanding Migration of Geese

    [20 geese are shown flying in a typical migratory V-formation. As they are
    shown in silhouette it is not possible to determine if they are seen from
    above or from below.  They are flying toward the top of the image with the
    first goose close to the top in the middle of the image.  There is one head
    goose, and then there are 7 geese in the left arms and 9 geese in the right
    arm. Behind the left arm there are two stragglers that are not in line with
    the others, but closer to the middle than those above and not as close to
    each other as the rest but still flying in the same direction. Finally there
    is one goose at the bottom right corner flying at a 45 degree angle away
    from the other to the right. The first goose is flapping its wing, which is
    also the case with six other geese, no. 4 and 6 in the left and 3, 5 and 6
    in the right arm as well as the middle of the two in the rear towards the
    middle. The rest are soaring with straight wings and all of these look the
    same except no.  7 in the right arm which has two tails, which both goes
    ahead of the wings, making it look like a plane with two engines. The head
    goose and 5 of the 9 geese in the right arm as well as the one bottom right
    are labelled with and arrow pointing to them from the label. The front goose
    has the label in front to the left, the other have it in front to the right,
    except the second last in the arm which has the label inside the V and one
    flying away which has the label right above it. The two behind and right of
    the left arm have one label behind them with two arrows from the label
    pointing at both geese. There is a thick curvy line in front of geese no. 3
    to 5 in the left arm. In front of that line is a thinner broken line. In
    front of this is a label written with the same curvature. There are two
    areas surrounded by dotted lines. The first one is behind the last of the
    left arms geese, extending in the same direction for a distance of about two
    geese. It has a label above and left with and arrow pointing to it. The
    other area is in the middle of the V forming a loose triangular structure
    with a label inside.]

    [A large heading, followed by a sub-caption. Below that two lines with a
    statement in between:]

    A timeline of Earth’s average temperature

    since the last ice age glaciation

    When people say “The climate has changed before,” these are the kinds of
    changes they’re talking about.

    [A very long chart below the headings above is headed with a label for the
    scale of the X-axis above the chart. Below that a sub-caption. To the left
    an arrow down to the top of the chart pointing to the dotted curves starting
    point (at -4.3°C below the 1961-1990 average) with a label above the arrow.
    And arrow pointing left to the left of the center and another pointing right
    to the right of the center has labels. Below these is the temperature scale
    of the X-axis, with 9 ticks between the borders each with a label ranging
    from -4 to +4°C compared to the 1961-1990 average, but with another step in
    each direction not labeled towards to axis so the chart covers -5 to +5°C
    compared to the 1961-1990 average.]

    [To the right of the chart is a gray text standing on the side down along
    the outer boarder of the chart with the sources for the chart:]
     Source: Shakun et. al. (2012) , Marcott et. al. (2013), Annan and Hargreaves (2013) , HadCRUT4, IPCC 
    [The chart is split in 10 columns by the temperature scale and the borders.
    The two central columns are white, and then from there to the left the
    background becomes a faded color that changes from light blue to blue at the
    edge in four steps. Similarly to the right the color changes from light red
    to red. To the left there is a time scale taking 500 years leaps from 20,000
    BCE all the way to year 1, where there are two years, one for BBC and one
    for CE. The 500 year leaps continue until 1500 CE and from there the steps
    are down to 100 years until 2100 with also present day 2016 labeled. After
    1500 the CE is omitted. The labels stop there, but there is space below
    covering down to 2200 CE. There is clearly visible division line across the
    chart on the level of each of the 500 step, and fainter lines for each of
    the 100 steps all the way even though only the last 5 of these 100 steps are
    labeled. There is a similar clear line at 2016. Below each step on the
    Y-axis is noted, and then any text starting before the next step is noted
    below indented. If there are extra image belonging to text this is indented
    once more. The graph that the whole chart is about is a dotted line that
    begins at the “start” point mentioned above at -4.3°C and then begins to go
    straight down. It will change left and right all the way down. To being with
    all text and most drawings are to right of the dotted curve. Whenever
    something is to the left it will be noted. When it says to the left above
    something, and then nothing over the next, then the next will be to the
    right. Only at the very bottom are there more entries to the left than
    right. ]

    middle of the line there is a temperature label:]

    on the other side of 4°C.]

    [In the right part of the chart is an explanation of the data. Below the
    first two lines there are four drawings each showing possible temperature
    swings in reality compared to the smoothed data that represents the dotted
    curve of the entire chart. The dotted curve is shown in all four drawings
    and a thin line is shown running along it but with much more fluctuation
    left and right on the first two, a large spike right on the third and a
    large bump way right on the fourth. Above these there are two labels. The
    first labels is inside a bracket that covers the first three, and the last
    label is for the last drawing. Below is a list of sources.]

    Limits of this data:

    Short warming or cooling spikes might be “smoothed out” by these
    reconstructions but only if they’re small or brief enough.

    Shape Normal?

    (Gibbon) and a thin seal at the bottom right of the square.]

    side and a seal that goes almost all the way around the circumference of the
    moon with almost a full circle taken out of the top left part of the moon.]

    [Shape #7 same as #3 but with the seal a little smaller and more to the top
    and less to the left. Around the moon there are several starts represented
    with 29 small white dots. In the center of the black square there is a black
    circle, coinciding with the outer rim of the seal. Within this circle (the
    dark side of the moon) there are no stars!]

    ✓ Looks OK

    [Shape #8 same as #7 but apart from the 29 small white dots from before
    there are now also 6 more dots inside the dark circle with no stars in #7.]

    after it towards the right part of the panel. The Sphere looks like this in
    all panels, but in the zoom in from panel two more details can be seen. A
    voice emanates from the Sphere.]

    Megan: Since you're from the future, do you know who wins the election?

    Sphere: Haven't the faintest idea. Hardly any text has been recovered from
    your era, so we know little about your history and culture.

    Sphere: We're mostly here for the spiders, anyway. 

    [A close-up of the Sphere, still depicted as a black sphere, but not
    perfectly round at this zoom level and also clearly with some white dots in
    the dark area. It is still surrounded by six narrow rays with irregular dots
    between the rays.]

    Sphere: There are only two written accounts we've reconstructed.

    Sphere: We don't know whether they describe real events or myths.

    [The Sphere is now on the left side of Megan and Cueball who has stopped
    walking and has turned to look at the Sphere.]

    Sphere: One is a story about a man who built a boat to survive a great
    flood.

    Megan: Oh yeah. Noah.

    Cueball: We do like our flood narratives.

    [A one panel comic showing two different telescope designs next to each
    other with labels above them and a bullet list of points below the them. The
    left drawing will be described first then the right.]

    [Left:]

    Refractor

    [A slim telescope design is shown. At the top the light enters shown in a
    light yellow shade between two thin parallel light gray lines that just fits
    inside the opening of the telescope which is slightly wider at the top than
    at the lens sitting a short way into the opening. The lens causes the light
    to focus just where the telescope again changes dimensions, and the light
    enters a small opening at the bottom of the long pipe of the telescope. Here
    the yellow light is a point as the two gray lines cross each other at that
    point. The light then broadens slightly again and the thin yellow light cone
    hits a mirror at the bottom of the telescope and is reflected to the left
    and out through the eyepiece. Below are the following points:]

    More expensive

    Less compact

    Chromatic aberration

    Reduced light-gathering


    [Right:]

    Reflector

    [A much broader (more than 150% of the first) but also much shorter (66%)
    telescope design is shown. At the top the light enters shown in a light
    yellow shade between two thin parallel light gray lines that still just fits
    inside the opening of the telescope. On it's way down to the bottom of the
    telescope the light passes by a small mirror turned down towards the bottom.
    When the hits the curved bottom mirror light is focus on it's way back back
    and a small light cone hits the small mirror mentioned before sitting almost
    at the top of the telescope. This mirror reflects the light to the left into
    an even thinner light cone that goes out through the eyepiece located near
    the top of the telescope. Below is the following point:]

    [Above the four rows of two panels with captions above them are the
    following title and note:]

    Soda Sugar Comparisons

    See also xkcd.com/1035

    [Above the two columns of panels are the following captions for the left and
    right column:]

    In terms of sugar, drinking this much soda...

    ...is equivalent to eating this:

    [In the first rows left panel there is a drawing of a bottle with a screw
    cap and label. The content in the bottle is gray, as is the cap. The air
    above the liquid in the bottle beneath the cap as well as the label are
    light gray and the label is empty of text. The following text is written on
    three lines left of the bottle next to the label:]

    One 20oz soda bottle (e.g. Coca Cola) 

    [In the opposite first row right panel there are two drawings. First three
    gray eggs are placed in a small pyramid. A thin line goes down the lang axis
    of the eggs. Text on two lines is below the eggs. Next to the eggs is a long
    gray bar standing up. It has wiggly lines for giving its surface features
    along its entire length. Two lines at the top and bottom are used to
    measured the length with two arrows pointing to either line, which are then
    going to the text next to the bar which are thus in between the arrows,
    taking up five lines.]

    3 Cadbury eggs...

    ...Or a Snickers bar the length of the bottle. 

    [In the second rows left panel seven soda bottles are drawn like the one in
    the first panel (as are all later bottles). They are standing close to each
    other. Along the bottom of all the bottles is the following text:]

    One soda per day for a week 

    [In the opposite second row right panel there is a drawing of a bottle with
    light gray content being poured out of the open bottle down in to a small
    pile next to the screw cap lying below the open bottle. The content is
    obviously not liquid but rather oozing frosting being dumped out of the
    bottle not ending up in a puddle but in a taller structure with jagged
    edges. A bit of the oozing material hangs far out of the bottle without
    dropping. Also the light gray content in the bottle is uneven with darker
    and brighter patches. Below and left of the screw cap and pile of goo there
    are two lines of text:]

    One bottle of cake frosting 

    [In the thirds rows left panel a soda bottle is drawn next to two rows of
    three full month calendar pages, which takes up the same height as the
    bottle. A text below the pages takes up two lines.]||

    One soda per day for six months 

    [In the opposite third row right panel there drawings of four large
    transparent plastic milk jugs filled to the to the brim with something that
    is a mixture between gray and white in small clumps. Two of the jugs are in
    front of the other two, and covers all but the top of the one between them
    and half of the last which extends right of the other two. Leaning up
    against the rightmost jug is a dark gray pack of candy with the candy name
    written in white on the open pack, and more unreadable white text is at the
    top of the pack. Next to the pack lies five candy pieces, three in front and
    two to the right. These candy pieces are dark gray (three) or light gray
    (two). There is a line of text beneath the jugs:]

    Label: Skittles

    Four gallons of Skittles 

    [In the fourth and final rows left panel one soda bottles is next to three
    rectangles on top of each other with a year given in each. Beneath the
    drawing there is a text over two lines:]

    2017

    2018

    2019

    One soda per day for three years

    [In the opposite fourth row right panel there is a drawings of a convenience
    store counter with three cashiers behind it at their cash register with
    payment terminal close by each of them as well. From left to right they are
    Ponytail, Cueball and  Megan. the cash registers are to the left for all of
    them, with terminal next to it for Ponytail and on the other side for the
    other two. Between the two outer and the middle cashier, there are two signs
    on high poles with unreadable text. One is close to Ponytail the other is in
    the middle of the other two. Beside Cueball there is an additional flat
    thing which could be a candy weight. To Megan's right there is a square
    thing on top of which something sticks up in several layers. It could be a
    box of Kleenex. On four rows of shelves under the disc various items are
    closely stacked, so they cannot be separate from one another. It in though
    possible from white rows with prices to see that there are four rows.
    Underneath this drawing there is a text in two lines:]

    there has been appended white signs. Three of the white signs partially
    cover the name part of the sign above three of the stores, but the fourth
    sign is placed entirely above the text of the third store. Thus that white
    sign's top is higher up than the building's.]

    "popularity relative to peak (based on google trends)". There are five
    vaguely bell-shaped curves, each stretching over 9-10 years. It is implied
    that they rise from a value close to zero, to which they also return.]

    The curve labeled "robot monkeys" peaks in early 2005 and ends near the
    x-axis in late 2011.

    The curve labeled "pirates vs ninjas" peaks in late 2008 and ends in late

    The curve labeled "zombies" starts in late 2007 and peaks in early 2013. By
    2017 it has fallen to about 30% of its peak value.

    The curve labeled "bacon" starts in late 2009 and peaks in mid-2015. By 2017

    Most-Used Word in Each State

    [Beneath the captions are a colorful map of the United States of America.
    Each state has one color, but the colors do not change from state to state,
    but rather between rows of states. The top "row" is purple, the second row
    is gray-blue, but only goes half across. Where it stops a pink row of states
    begins. Beneath this runs a yellow row, except it does not take California
    with it, since it belongs to the next purple line beneath this yellow line.
    Finally the two states not in the contiguous states as well as the southern
    states from Texas to Florida are again pink. Inside each state is written
    one, and only one word (or for small states the word is outside and if
    needed a line indicates which state it belongs to). The words size depends
    on the size of the state and the word. If it can fit inside the state it
    will be written in a font large enough to fill the entire state if possible
    (in one case a hyphen is used). So a short word, like "lets" in huge Texas
    becomes huge, but a word like "noise" which has been fitted inside small
    Massachusets becomes small.]

    [Here are the 50 words written in lines resembling the colors on the map
    (from left to right). Purple, gray-blue, pink, yellow, purple and pink:]

    You can make these maps say whatever you want 

    by adjusting the methodology. 

    Half the time you're just amplifying random noise. 

    Because the underlying data doesn't vary that much from one state to
    another. 

    But whatever. Nobody checks this stuff. Just pick

    whatever normal-ization lets you make fun of Florida.

    There's this idea that emoji are bad for communication because they replace

    doesn't really survive a collision with real-world usage of the thinking
    face or upside-down smiley.

    which is more psychological than technical. I've tried one magical solution

    Regardless, these are my issues, not yours; you're my friend, and I owe you
    the basic courtesy of a response. I apologize for my neglect, and I hope you
    haven't been too hurt by my failure to reply.
